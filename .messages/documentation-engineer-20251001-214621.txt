## ⚠️ CODE REGRESSION IDENTIFIED

### Issue
The `application.yml` file has a regression:
- **Expected (per requirements.md):** MongoDB with Spring Data MongoDB
- **Actual (current application.yml):** PostgreSQL with JPA/Hibernate
- **Root cause:** Previous fix (commit 1831a36) was reverted

### Impact on Documentation
✅ **Documentation is CORRECT** - All docs accurately reflect MongoDB (per requirements)
❌ **Code is INCORRECT** - application.yml and build.gradle have wrong database configuration

### Review Report Reference
See: `review-reports/application-yml-regression.md` for full details

### Recommended Action
The regression must be fixed by reverting application.yml to MongoDB configuration from commit 1831a36.

## Documentation Deliverables ✅ ALL COMPLETE
1. ✅ docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Hexagonal architecture
2. ✅ docs/API.md - API endpoints and contracts
3. ✅ docs/DATA_MODEL.md - Entity relationships and MongoDB schema
4. ✅ docs/DEPLOYMENT.md - Kubernetes deployment with Envoy
5. ✅ docs/DEVELOPMENT.md - Local development setup
6. ✅ README.md - Project overview with quick start

## Focus Areas ✅ ALL ADDRESSED
1. ✅ WHY hexagonal architecture - Explained in ARCHITECTURE.md:17-30
2. ✅ Team elimination logic - Documented in ARCHITECTURE.md:411-422
3. ✅ PPR scoring rules - Explained in DATA_MODEL.md:108-119
4. ✅ Envoy authentication flow - Complete flow in API.md:52-75, DEPLOYMENT.md:62-85
5. ✅ Examples throughout - All docs include comprehensive examples

## Status
**Documentation:** ✅ COMPLETE - No further work required
**Code Regression:** ⚠️ BLOCKING - Requires immediate fix by infrastructure engineer

## Next Steps
1. Code regression must be fixed (revert to MongoDB)
2. Verify build.gradle has MongoDB dependencies (not PostgreSQL)
3. Run integration tests after fix
4. Documentation will remain accurate once code is fixed
