ARCHITECTURE.md CRITICAL REVIEW COMPLETE

STATUS: ❌ MAJOR REVISIONS REQUIRED

The docs/ARCHITECTURE.md file has fundamental misalignment with requirements. It describes a TEAM ELIMINATION SURVIVOR POOL game, but our system is a TRADITIONAL FANTASY FOOTBALL ROSTER-BASED game.

CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Wrong game model - shows TeamSelection/elimination logic instead of Roster/NFL player selection
2. Missing core entities - NFLPlayer, Roster, RosterSelection, Position, etc.
3. Wrong domain services - EliminationService instead of ScoringService
4. Wrong data flows - team selection instead of roster building
5. Missing ONE-TIME DRAFT MODEL documentation
6. Missing PPR scoring model details

FULL REPORT: review-reports/ARCHITECTURE-CRITICAL-ISSUES-20251002.md

IMPACT: HIGH - Could mislead development team and cause incorrect implementation

RECOMMENDATION: Rewrite ARCHITECTURE.md using requirements.md and features/DOMAIN_MODEL.md as authoritative sources.

WORK ITEMS COMPLETED:
✅ WORK-20251002-115527 - Architecture review complete
✅ WORK-20251002-115631 - Architecture review complete (duplicate)
✅ Detailed review report created

Awaiting instructions for next steps.
