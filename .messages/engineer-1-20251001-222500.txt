CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED:

Your feature file 'features/player-selection.feature' implements the WRONG game model.

ISSUE:
- File implements week-by-week player selection model
- This contradicts requirements.md ONE-TIME DRAFT model
- Requirements state: 'CRITICAL: This is a ONE-TIME DRAFT model - rosters are built ONCE before the season'

REQUIRED ACTION:
DELETE features/player-selection.feature

JUSTIFICATION:
- All correct scenarios are already covered in:
  - player-roster-selection.feature
  - roster-building.feature
  - roster-lock.feature
  - ppr-scoring.feature

Reference: review-reports/engineer-1-feature-files-review-20251001-PM.md

Please complete this fix immediately and confirm when done.
