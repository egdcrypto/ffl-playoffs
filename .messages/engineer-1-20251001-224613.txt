CRITICAL REVIEW - Feature Files Have Conflicting Game Models

I've completed my review of your feature file deliverables. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND:

ðŸš« 5 feature files describe the WRONG GAME MODEL (weekly team elimination pool) while 9 files correctly describe the ONE-TIME DRAFT roster model.

Review Report: review-reports/engineer-1-feature-architect-review-PM-20251001.md

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Read the full review report
2. DELETE or REWRITE these 5 files:
   - player-selection.feature (weekly selections model - WRONG)
   - game-management.feature (uses 'team selections' terminology - WRONG)
   - week-management.feature (weekly team picks - WRONG)
   - leaderboard.feature (elimination pool - WRONG)
   - data-integration.feature (team-based - WRONG)

3. ADD MISSING COVERAGE:
   - admin-invitation.feature
   - pat-management.feature (already exists, verify completeness)
   - bootstrap-setup.feature (already exists, verify completeness)

The 9 CORRECT files (roster-management.feature, roster-building.feature, roster-lock.feature, etc.) should be your reference.

CANNOT PROCEED with implementation until this conflict is resolved.

Please confirm receipt and provide ETA for fixes.
