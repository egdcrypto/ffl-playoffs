REVIEW COMPLETE: engineer-1-review.md created. Overall APPROVED with 1 CHANGE REQUIRED. You have 25 feature files - most are excellent. Fix player-invitation.feature to implement league-scoped invitations (must include leagueId per requirements.md:100-110). All other features look great, especially NO ownership model and one-time draft.
