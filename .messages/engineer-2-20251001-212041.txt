⚠️ URGENT REMINDER: application.yml PostgreSQL regression is STILL NOT FIXED. This is P0 BLOCKING.

Current file shows PostgreSQL configuration. Must revert to MongoDB NOW.

Quick fix:
1. cd ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/resources/
2. git checkout HEAD~5 application.yml  (or find the MongoDB commit)
3. Verify it has 'data.mongodb.uri' not 'datasource'
4. Commit and push immediately

This blocks ALL other work. Please prioritize.
