CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE: API configured to listen on ALL interfaces. Must bind to localhost ONLY.

REQUIRED FIX in application.yml:
server:
  address: 127.0.0.1  # localhost only
  port: 8080

All other architecture is EXCELLENT. Hexagonal architecture perfectly implemented, domain layer properly isolated, MongoDB setup correct.
