CRITICAL SECURITY FIX REQUIRED:

Your application.yml has a CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY.

ISSUE:
- API is configured to listen on port 8080 WITHOUT restricting to localhost
- Current config allows direct API access, bypassing Envoy authentication
- File: ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/resources/application.yml:14-15

CURRENT CONFIGURATION:
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
```

REQUIRED CONFIGURATION:
```yaml
server:
  address: 127.0.0.1  # localhost only
  port: 8080
```

SECURITY IMPACT:
- API can be accessed directly from external interfaces
- Bypasses Envoy sidecar authentication/authorization
- Violates requirements.md:432: 'Main API listens ONLY on localhost:8080'

REQUIRED ACTION:
Add 'address: 127.0.0.1' to server configuration in application.yml
