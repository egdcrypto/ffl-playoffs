WORK COMPLETED: Both assigned tasks successfully implemented.

## WORK-20251001-223522-3228476: PersonalAccessToken Entity ✅
Created complete PAT authentication system:

**Files Created:**
- domain/model/PATScope.java - Enum with READ_ONLY, WRITE, ADMIN scopes
- domain/model/PersonalAccessToken.java - Full entity implementation

**Features Implemented:**
✅ All required fields: id, name, tokenHash (BCrypt), scope, expiresAt, createdBy, lastUsedAt, revoked
✅ Token validation logic (isValid(), validateOrThrow())
✅ Scope-based permission checking (hasScope())
✅ Token lifecycle methods (revoke(), updateLastUsed())
✅ Expiration checking (isExpired())
✅ Custom InvalidTokenException for validation failures
✅ Pure domain model - zero framework dependencies

## WORK-20251001-223520-3228161: LeaguePlayer Junction Entity ✅
**Status:** Already completed by another engineer

**File:** domain/model/LeaguePlayer.java
- Links User to League with league-specific data
- Includes: id, userId, leagueId, joinedAt, status
- Supports multi-league membership
- Complete business logic for invitation workflow
- Status transitions: INVITED → ACTIVE/DECLINED, deactivation, removal

Both implementations follow hexagonal architecture principles with framework-agnostic domain models.
