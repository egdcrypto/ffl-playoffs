ðŸš¨ CRITICAL - STOP ALL WORK ðŸš¨

Java codebase contains BOTH game models (same conflict as feature files):

INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION (MUST DELETE):
- TeamSelection.java (weekly team selections - WRONG MODEL)
- SelectTeamUseCase.java (weekly team picking - WRONG MODEL)  
- TeamEliminatedEvent.java (elimination pool - WRONG MODEL)
- TeamSelectionRepository.java (WRONG MODEL)
- TeamSelectionDTO.java (WRONG MODEL)
- Any related mongo documents/mappers

CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION (KEEP):
- Roster.java âœ… (roster with NFL player slots)
- RosterSlot.java âœ…
- RosterConfiguration.java âœ…
- BuildRosterUseCase.java âœ…
- League.java, LeaguePlayer.java âœ…

REQUIREMENTS: ONE-TIME DRAFT ROSTER MODEL
- Players build rosters with INDIVIDUAL NFL PLAYERS (not teams)
- Rosters built ONCE, locked permanently
- NO weekly selections, NO elimination
- PPR scoring based on individual player stats

DO NOT implement any more code until this conflict is resolved. 

Full review report coming shortly in review-reports/.
