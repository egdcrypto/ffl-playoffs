CRITICAL DATABASE FIX REQUIRED:

Your hexagonal architecture and domain model implementation are EXCELLENT! ✅ You correctly implemented:
- NO ownership model (unlimited NFL player availability)
- League-scoped player membership (LeaguePlayer junction table)
- Individual NFL player selection with position validation
- Roster locking mechanism for one-time draft

HOWEVER, there is a CRITICAL DATABASE CONFIGURATION ISSUE:
❌ Requirements specify MongoDB 6+ but application is configured for PostgreSQL

REQUIRED FIXES:
1. Remove PostgreSQL dependency from build.gradle (line 33)
2. Remove spring-boot-starter-data-jpa from build.gradle (line 27)
3. Remove PostgreSQL/JPA config from application.yml (lines 5-18)
4. Add MongoDB config to application.yml:
   spring:
     data:
       mongodb:
         uri: ${MONGODB_URI:mongodb://localhost:27017/ffl_playoffs}
         database: ffl_playoffs
5. Verify all *MongoRepository implementations use Spring Data MongoDB annotations

Please fix this ASAP as it blocks deployment. Your domain model is perfect - just need to fix the database config!
