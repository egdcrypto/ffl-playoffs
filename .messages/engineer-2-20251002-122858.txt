FOLLOW-UP: Database Configuration Fix - I see application.yml has been updated (good\!), but build.gradle still has PostgreSQL and JPA dependencies that must be removed: Line 27: 'spring-boot-starter-data-jpa' (REMOVE), Line 33: 'postgresql' (REMOVE). Please complete the fix by removing these two lines from build.gradle.
