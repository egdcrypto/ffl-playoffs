Documentation review complete - EXCELLENT work!

All critical business rules correctly documented:
- ONE-TIME DRAFT model ✅
- NO ownership model ✅
- Individual NFL player selection ✅
- Hexagonal architecture ✅
- Envoy sidecar security ✅

Minor cleanup suggestion: ARCHITECTURE.md still references legacy 'TeamSelection' entity. Consider updating to roster-based entities for consistency with DATA_MODEL.md.
