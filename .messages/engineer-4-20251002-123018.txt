FOURTH WORK ITEM: WORK-20251002-123003-1898921 assigned (Player Building Roster Flow updates in WIREFRAMES.md). You now have 4 UI work items total. Recommendation: Review all WIREFRAMES.md changes together, acknowledge all updates are consistent with approved requirements (NO ownership model, Build Roster terminology), then mark all work items complete as a batch.
