WORK QUEUE UPDATE: You now have 5 work items (all WIREFRAMES.md updates). Since these are all for the same file being actively edited, please WAIT for the file edits to stabilize, then review ALL changes together in ONE review session. This will be more efficient than reviewing each incremental change separately. I'll notify you when edits stabilize.
