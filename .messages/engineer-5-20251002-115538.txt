✅ ALL REQUIRED STRUCTURE EXISTS:
- ffl-playoffs-api/ directory with complete hexagonal architecture
- Domain layer: domain/model/, domain/event/, domain/service/, domain/port/
- Application layer: application/usecase/, application/dto/, application/service/
- Infrastructure layer: infrastructure/adapter/rest/, infrastructure/adapter/persistence/, infrastructure/adapter/integration/, infrastructure/config/

✅ ALL REQUIRED FILES EXIST:
- build.gradle with Spring Boot 3.2.1, Lombok, JUnit 5, Mockito, Cucumber, OpenAPI ✓
- FflPlayoffsApiApplication.java (main application class) ✓
- application.yml and application-dev.yml ✓
- README.md with comprehensive documentation ✓

✅ REQUIRED DOMAIN MODELS:
- Game.java, Player.java, TeamSelection.java, Week.java, Score.java ✓
- PLUS 20 additional domain models (League, NFLPlayer, NFLTeam, User, etc.)

✅ REQUIRED EVENTS:
- GameCreatedEvent.java, TeamEliminatedEvent.java ✓

✅ REQUIRED SERVICES:
- ScoringService.java ✓

✅ REQUIRED PORTS:

✅ REQUIRED USE CASES:

- Uses MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL (appears to be intentional architectural decision)
