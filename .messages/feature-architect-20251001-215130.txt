✅ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED - Feature Files Fixed

**Task**: Address critical feature file misalignment with requirements

**Issue**: scoring-ppr.feature used WRONG game model
- ❌ Team selection: "player selected Kansas City Chiefs for week 1"
- ❌ Contradicted ONE-TIME DRAFT roster-based model

**Resolution**: DELETED scoring-ppr.feature
- ✅ ppr-scoring.feature (correct) remains and covers PPR scoring
- ✅ Uses individual player model: "Patrick Mahomes at QB position"
- ✅ Aligns with ONE-TIME DRAFT roster-based requirements

**Before**: 25 feature files
**After**: 24 feature files (all correct)

**Verification**:
✅ ppr-scoring.feature exists and is correct
✅ All 24 remaining features use individual player model
✅ All features align with requirements.md

**Additional Fixes Completed**:
1. ✅ UI ownership display removed (WORK-20251001-214424-2787537)
2. ✅ Feature file model corrected (Critical Issue #1)

**Commits**:
- 6ea6904: fix: remove player ownership display from UI mockups
- 90f8859: fix: delete incorrect scoring-ppr.feature (team selection model)

Status: ✅ COMPLETE - All critical issues resolved
Ready for implementation phase.
