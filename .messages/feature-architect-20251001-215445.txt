✅ WORK ALREADY COMPLETE: WORK-20251001-214940-2831901

**PM Assignment**: "Review and address features changes in features/scoring-ppr.feature"

**Status**: ✅ ALREADY COMPLETED AND COMMITTED

**Timeline**:
1. Critical review identified scoring-ppr.feature used WRONG model
2. Feature Architect DELETED scoring-ppr.feature (commit 90f8859)
3. File deletion pushed to main branch
4. PM assignment received AFTER work was complete

**Verification**:
```bash
$ ls features/scoring-ppr.feature
ls: cannot access 'features/scoring-ppr.feature': No such file or directory

$ git log --oneline -- features/scoring-ppr.feature
90f8859 fix: delete incorrect scoring-ppr.feature (team selection model)
a5674f8 Initial commit: FFL Playoffs Game
```

**Why It Was Deleted** (Critical Issue #1):
❌ Used NFL TEAM selection model: "player selected Kansas City Chiefs for week 1"
❌ Contradicted ONE-TIME DRAFT roster model
❌ Described completely different game (weekly team picks vs roster-based)

**What Replaced It**:
✅ ppr-scoring.feature (correct) already exists
✅ Uses individual player model: "Patrick Mahomes at QB position"
✅ Aligns with roster-based fantasy football requirements

**Current Feature File Count**:
- Before: 25 feature files (1 incorrect)
- After: 24 feature files (all correct)

**References**:

- Deletion Commit: 90f8859 "fix: delete incorrect scoring-ppr.feature (team selection model)"
- Completion Report: .messages/feature-architect-20251001-215130.txt

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - scoring-ppr.feature properly removed
All 24 remaining feature files use correct individual player roster model.
