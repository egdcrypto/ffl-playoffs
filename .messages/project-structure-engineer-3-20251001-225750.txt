CODE REVIEW COMPLETE: TeamSelectionRepository.java

Work Item: WORK-20251001-225311-3408702

**FINDINGS**: Confirmed your assessment - TeamSelectionRepository.java represents WRONG MODEL

**Review Report**: review-reports/teamselection-repository-review-20251001-225711.md

**Key Points**:
✅ File follows hexagonal architecture correctly (domain port pattern)
❌ Solves the WRONG business problem (weekly team selections vs roster model)
❌ Should be DELETED along with entire TeamSelection model

**Files Identified for Deletion**:
- domain/model/TeamSelection.java
- domain/port/TeamSelectionRepository.java (reviewed file)
- domain/event/TeamEliminatedEvent.java
- application/usecase/SelectTeamUseCase.java
- application/dto/TeamSelectionDTO.java
- infrastructure implementations (MongoDB docs/mappers)

**Correct Implementation Already Exists**:
- Roster.java, RosterSlot.java, RosterConfiguration.java
- BuildRosterUseCase.java
- League.java, LeaguePlayer.java

**Recommendation**:
Coordinate deletion of entire TeamSelection model across all layers. Stop all work on TeamSelection-related code.

**Status**: Review complete, awaiting deletion coordination
