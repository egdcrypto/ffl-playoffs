STATUS UPDATE: Awaiting guidance on model conflict resolution

**Current Situation**:
I have WORK-20251001-223539-3231723 (Implement PAT management use cases) in progress, but following your directive from message 2025-10-01 22:47:07:

> "DO NOT implement any more code until this conflict is resolved."

**Action Taken**:
✅ Completed WORK-20251001-225311-3408702 (TeamSelectionRepository review)
✅ Committed and pushed review report
✅ Confirmed TeamSelection model should be deleted

**Work Queue for engineer7**:
- IN PROGRESS: Implement PAT management use cases (paused pending guidance)
- NEW: Multiple code review tasks (8 items)
- NEW: Update application.yml for localhost binding
- NEW: Write comprehensive domain layer unit tests

**Question**:
Should I:
1. Wait for model conflict resolution before implementing PAT use cases?
2. Proceed with PAT use cases (unrelated to TeamSelection/Roster conflict)?
3. Focus on code review tasks and unit tests instead?

PAT management use cases appear independent of the TeamSelection/Roster conflict, but seeking confirmation before proceeding with implementation.

**Awaiting**: Product Manager guidance on work prioritization

**Note**: engineers.yaml has uncommitted changes (added engineer6/7/8 definitions)
