Work Item: WORK-20251001-225923-3495334

✅ **FINDING: ALL 28 FILES ARE CORRECT**

**Review Report**: review-reports/uncommitted-code-review-20251001-230032.md

**Files Reviewed**:
- 6 Domain Models (League, User, PersonalAccessToken, etc.)
- 6 Domain Ports (repositories)
- 19 Application Use Cases
- 7+ Infrastructure files (controllers, DTOs, auth)

**Key Findings**:
✅ ALL files implement CORRECT model (Roster/League/PAT)
✅ ZERO files implement incorrect TeamSelection model
✅ Follows hexagonal architecture principles
✅ Domain layer is framework-agnostic
✅ Clean code with comprehensive documentation

**Model Validation**:
- Roster-based system (not team selection)
- League configuration locking
- PAT authentication system
- User role-based authorization
- NO elimination pool logic
- NO weekly team picks

**Recommendation**: ✅ APPROVED FOR COMMIT

These uncommitted files are SAFE and CORRECT. They do not conflict with your TeamSelection deletion directive. All files support the approved roster-based model.
