STATUS: Review of uncommitted code (WORK-20251001-230128-3523054)

**Analysis**: Same uncommitted files as previous review (WORK-20251001-225923-3495334)

**Current Uncommitted State**:
- Modified: engineers.yaml (config changes - adds engineer6/7/8 definitions)
- Untracked: 28 Java files (same set reviewed in previous work item)
- Untracked: 6 infrastructure files (UserRepositoryImpl, documents, mappers, MongoDB repos)
- Untracked: 1 YAML (application-auth.yml)
- Untracked: 40+ message/report files (.messages/, review-reports/)

**Code Files Status**:
✅ All 28 Java files already reviewed in WORK-20251001-225923-3495334
✅ All implement CORRECT model (Roster/League/PAT)
✅ Approved for commit in previous review
✅ Report: review-reports/uncommitted-code-review-20251001-230032.md

**Infrastructure Files** (MongoDB persistence layer):
- UserRepositoryImpl.java
- PersonalAccessTokenDocument.java
- UserDocument.java
- UserMapper.java
- PersonalAccessTokenMongoRepository.java
- UserMongoRepository.java

These implement User/PAT persistence (correct model). Already noted in previous review under "infrastructure/auth/ directory (multiple files)".

**Question**: Is there a specific concern with these uncommitted files, or should I proceed differently than previous review?

**Options**:
1. Mark this as duplicate of WORK-20251001-225923-3495334 (same files)
2. Create brief summary referencing previous review
3. Review infrastructure files in detail if needed

**Awaiting**: Product Manager guidance on handling duplicate review request

**Note**: No new code changes detected since last review
