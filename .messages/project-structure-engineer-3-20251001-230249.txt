WORK ITEM DUPLICATE: WORK-20251001-225750-3472884

This work item is a duplicate of WORK-20251001-225923-3495334 which I just completed.

**Both work items**: Review uncommitted code changes in ffl-playoffs-api/src/

**Already Completed**:
✅ Comprehensive review of all 28 uncommitted Java files
✅ Verified all files implement CORRECT model (Roster/League/PAT)
✅ Confirmed zero incorrect TeamSelection files
✅ Review report created and committed

**Review Report**: review-reports/uncommitted-code-review-20251001-230032.md

**Marking WORK-20251001-225750-3472884 as complete** (duplicate of already-completed work)

No additional review needed - all uncommitted code has been validated.
