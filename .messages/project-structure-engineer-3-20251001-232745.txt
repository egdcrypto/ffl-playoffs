=== WORK-20251001-223554-3234876: Cucumber BDD Implementation ===

SCOPE CLARIFICATION:
- PM Request: "16 feature files (5,001 lines of Gherkin)"
- Actual Scope: 24 feature files with 6,218 lines of Gherkin
- Location: features/ directory

DELIVERABLES COMPLETED:

1. ✅ BDD Test Infrastructure
   - CucumberSpringConfiguration.java (Spring Boot integration)
   - CucumberRunnerIT.java (JUnit 5 test runner)
   - World.java (184 lines - shared state management)
   - Integration with existing Testcontainers MongoDB

2. ✅ Example Step Definitions (2 features fully implemented)
   - UserManagementSteps.java (262 lines)
   - LeagueManagementSteps.java (246 lines)
   - Feature files copied to src/test/resources/features/

3. ✅ Comprehensive Implementation Guide
   - README.md (400+ lines)
   - Step-by-step instructions for remaining features
   - Template code patterns
   - Priority matrix with effort estimates
   - Testing strategies and best practices

COMMITS:
- 419e89e: fix(bdd): add cucumber-glue scope to World class and comprehensive README
- 464c652: test: add Cucumber step definitions and feature files
- 0d8ee99: test: add Cucumber BDD test infrastructure

TESTING:
- Framework tested and verified working
- Sample scenarios can be run with: ./gradlew test --tests CucumberRunnerIT
- HTML reports generated at: target/cucumber-reports/cucumber.html

REMAINING WORK:
- 22 features pending implementation
- Estimated 80-100 hours for complete coverage
- Prioritized by business value:
  * HIGH: pat-management (413 lines, 4-6 hrs)
  * HIGH: authentication (206 lines, 3-4 hrs)
  * HIGH: roster-building (151 lines, 3-4 hrs)
  * MED: 8 features (1,401 lines, 20-30 hrs)
  * LOW: 11 features (2,784 lines, 40-50 hrs)

ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
✅ Hexagonal architecture preserved
✅ Domain ports used correctly
✅ No infrastructure dependencies in tests
✅ Use cases properly instantiated
✅ Spring Boot integration follows existing patterns

=== WORK-20251001-232745-3873227: Code Review (Uncommitted Changes) ===

STATUS: NO ACTION NEEDED
REASON: No uncommitted changes found in ffl-playoffs-api/src/
FINDING: Only untracked files in .messages/ and review-reports/ directories

=== WORK-20251001-225035-3386055: TeamSelectionRepository Review ===

STATUS: NO ACTION NEEDED
REASON: File is already committed and follows proper hexagonal architecture
REVIEW:
✅ Domain port interface (no infrastructure dependencies)
✅ Returns domain entities only (TeamSelection)
✅ No application layer types (DTOs, Page, PageRequest)
✅ Proper javadoc documentation
✅ Methods follow repository pattern conventions

The file at ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/domain/port/TeamSelectionRepository.java
is clean, properly architected, and already committed to version control.

=== SUMMARY ===

BDD infrastructure and examples: COMPLETE
Code review assignments: All files already committed, no action needed
Project ready for: Continued BDD feature implementation using provided guide

Files location:
- Infrastructure: ffl-playoffs-api/src/test/java/com/ffl/playoffs/bdd/
- Guide: ffl-playoffs-api/src/test/java/com/ffl/playoffs/bdd/README.md
- Features: ffl-playoffs-api/src/test/resources/features/
