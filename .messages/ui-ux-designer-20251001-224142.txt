READY FOR HANDOFF
-----------------
‚úÖ Frontend engineers can begin React/Vue implementation
‚úÖ Backend engineers have clear API endpoint requirements
‚úÖ QA engineers have comprehensive user flows for testing
‚úÖ Stakeholders have working HTML mockups for review
‚úÖ Product managers have full feature visibility

NEXT STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION TEAM
-----------------------------------
1. Frontend Engineers:
   - Review ui-design/COMPONENTS.md for component specs
   - Use ui-design/mockups/*.html as reference implementations
   - Follow responsive breakpoints in COMPONENTS.md
   - Implement components in chosen framework (React/Vue/Angular)

2. Backend Engineers:
   - Review ui-design/API-INTEGRATION.md for endpoint requirements
   - Implement REST API endpoints as documented
   - Follow authentication flow (Google OAuth + JWT)
   - Support polling for real-time updates (leaderboards)

3. QA Engineers:
   - Use ui-design/WIREFRAMES.md for user flow testing
   - Test all responsive breakpoints
   - Verify accessibility (keyboard nav, screen readers)
   - Test state transitions (pre-lock ‚Üí locked)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Start with Player Dashboard, Team Selection, and Leaderboard (80% of usage)
2. Use Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind CSS for rapid implementation
3. Consider React or Vue for component-based architecture
4. Implement countdown timer with WebSocket for accuracy
5. Use progressive enhancement (core functionality works everywhere)
6. Test on real devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

OPEN QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDERS
-------------------------------
1. Dark mode support? (Design system ready, not yet implemented)
2. Push notifications for deadlines? (Design includes alerts)
3. Offline mode for viewing picks/standings? (Architecture supports)
4. Historical stats screen? (Marked as future enhancement)
5. Profile settings screen? (Marked as future enhancement)
