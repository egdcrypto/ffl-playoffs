CHANGES COMMITTED
-----------------

### 1. Documentation Consolidation ✅
- Merged root ARCHITECTURE.md content into docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Removed duplicate root ARCHITECTURE.md file
- Eliminated documentation fragmentation
- Created single source of truth in docs/

### 2. NEW SECTION: Technology Stack ✅
**Location**: Section 2 (after Overview)

Added comprehensive technology stack documentation:
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Data MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB 6+
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0, Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- **Security**: Envoy Sidecar with External Authorization (ext_authz)
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Proxy**: Envoy 1.28+

**Validation**: ✅ Accurate and complete

### 3. NEW SECTION: Security Architecture ✅
**Location**: Section 5 (after Architecture Layers)

Added comprehensive security architecture documentation:

**Three-Service Pod Architecture**:
```
┌─── KUBERNETES POD ───────────────────────────┐
│  Envoy Sidecar (Port 443) ← External Entry  │
│       ↓                                       │
│  Auth Service (localhost:9191)               │
│       ↓                                       │
│  Main API (localhost:8080)                   │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Documentation**:
- Network isolation (Main API and Auth Service localhost-only)
- Authentication flow for Google OAuth (10 steps)
- Authentication flow for PATs (10 steps)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules
- Endpoint security requirements
- Resource ownership validation

**Validation**: ✅ Comprehensive and architecturally sound

### 4. NEW SECTION: Configuration Immutability ✅
**Location**: Section 7 (after Domain Model)

Added critical business rule documentation:

**Business Rule**: ALL league configuration becomes IMMUTABLE once the first game starts

**Documented Components**:
- Lock mechanism and trigger conditions
- Validation guard implementation
- List of all immutable fields (8 fields)
- Configuration lock lifecycle diagram
- Timeline example with specific timestamps
- Domain event: `LeagueConfigurationLockedEvent`
- Event handlers and notifications

**Validation**: ✅ Critical business rule properly documented

### 5. NEW SECTION: Deployment Architecture ✅
**Location**: Section 9 (before Design Decisions)

Added deployment-specific documentation:

**Kubernetes Deployment**:
- Pod configuration (3 replicas)
- Container specifications (Envoy, Auth, Main API)
- Port mappings and network policies
- Service mesh configuration
- LoadBalancer service setup

**Network Policy**:
- Ingress rules for port 443 only
- Block direct access to ports 8080 and 9191
- Localhost-only enforcement

**Database Schema**:
- `leagues` collection schema
- `weeks` collection schema
- Index definitions for performance
- Configuration lock fields documented

**Validation**: ✅ Deployment-ready specifications

### 6. Updated Table of Contents ✅
**Old Structure** (7 sections):
1. Overview
2. Hexagonal Architecture
3. Architecture Layers
4. Dependency Rules
5. Ports and Adapters
6. Domain Model
7. Data Flow
8. Design Decisions

**New Structure** (10 sections):
1. Overview
2. **Technology Stack** (NEW)
3. Hexagonal Architecture
4. Architecture Layers
5. **Security Architecture** (NEW)
6. Domain Model
7. **Configuration Immutability** (NEW)
8. Data Flow
9. **Deployment Architecture** (NEW)
10. Design Decisions

**Validation**: ✅ Table of contents accurately reflects new structure
