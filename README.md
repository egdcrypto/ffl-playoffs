# FFL Playoffs Game

A **roster-based fantasy football application** with a unique **ONE-TIME DRAFT** model. League players build rosters by drafting individual NFL players across multiple positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF, FLEX, SUPERFLEX). Once the first game starts, rosters are **permanently locked** for the entire season—no waiver wire, no trades, no lineup changes. Compete for a configurable duration (1-17 weeks) with fully customizable roster configurations and PPR (Points Per Reception) scoring.

## Overview

FFL Playoffs is an **enterprise-grade fantasy football application** with a unique **ONE-TIME DRAFT** model:

### 🎯 Core Concept: ONE-TIME DRAFT Model

**CRITICAL RULE**: Rosters are built **ONCE** before the season starts and are **PERMANENTLY LOCKED** when the first NFL game begins.

**Pre-Lock Phase (Draft Phase)**:
- League players draft individual NFL players to fill all roster positions
- Players can modify their rosters (add/drop players) until the first game starts
- Countdown timer shows time remaining until permanent lock
- Admin-configurable roster structure (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF, FLEX, SUPERFLEX)

**Post-Lock Phase (Season Active)**:
- Rosters are **PERMANENTLY LOCKED** for the entire season
- **NO waiver wire** pickups allowed
- **NO trades** between league players
- **NO lineup changes** week-to-week
- **NO player replacements** (even for injuries)
- League players compete with their locked rosters for the full duration

### 🏈 Roster-Based Gameplay

- **Individual NFL Player Selection**: Build rosters by selecting individual NFL players by position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF)
- **No Ownership Model**: Multiple league players CAN select the same NFL player—ALL players available to ALL league members
- **Customizable Rosters**: FLEX positions (RB/WR/TE eligible) and SUPERFLEX positions (QB/RB/WR/TE eligible)
- **Position-Based Scoring**: PPR scoring based on each individual NFL player's weekly performance
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Start at any NFL week (1-22, including playoffs), run for any duration (1-17 weeks)

### 🔑 Key Differentiators

1. **ONE-TIME DRAFT**: Permanent roster lock creates unique strategic challenge—must live with draft decisions
2. **Configurable Roster Positions**: Admin-defined roster slots with flexible position eligibility
3. **No Ownership Model**: All NFL players available to all league players (not a traditional draft)
4. **Flexible Scheduling**: Start at any NFL week (1-22), not just week 1
5. **League-Scoped Players**: Players belong to specific leagues, supporting multi-league participation
6. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Envoy sidecar with custom auth service, Google OAuth, and PATs
7. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability and testability

## Key Features

### Core Gameplay (ONE-TIME DRAFT Model)
- 🔓 **Pre-Lock Roster Building**: Draft individual NFL players across multiple positions before season starts
- 🔒 **Permanent Roster Lock**: Rosters lock when first game starts—NO changes for entire season
- 🏈 **Position-Based Rosters**: QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF, FLEX (RB/WR/TE), SUPERFLEX (QB/RB/WR/TE)
- 🚫 **No Waiver Wire/Trades**: Live with your draft decisions—no pickups, trades, or lineup changes
- 📊 **Individual Player Scoring**: PPR scoring based on each NFL player's weekly performance
- 🏆 **Real-Time Leaderboards**: Live standings with cumulative roster score breakdowns

### League Configuration
- 📅 **Flexible Start Weeks**: Begin at any NFL week (1-22, including playoffs)
- ⏱️ **Configurable Duration**: 1-17 weeks (default: 4 weeks for playoffs)
- 📋 **Roster Configuration**: Admin defines position requirements
  - Quarterbacks (QB): 0-4 slots
  - Running Backs (RB): 0-6 slots
  - Wide Receivers (WR): 0-6 slots
  - Tight Ends (TE): 0-3 slots
  - Kickers (K): 0-2 slots
  - Defense/ST (DEF): 0-2 slots
  - FLEX (RB/WR/TE): 0-3 slots
  - Superflex (QB/RB/WR/TE): 0-2 slots
- ⚙️ **Custom Scoring Rules**:
  - Individual player PPR scoring (passing, rushing, receiving, TDs, INTs, fumbles)
  - PPR format: Full PPR (1.0), Half PPR (0.5), or Standard (0.0)
  - Field goal scoring by distance (0-39, 40-49, 50+ yards)
  - Defensive scoring (sacks, INTs, fumbles, TDs)
  - Points allowed and yards allowed tiers

### User Management
- 👥 **Three-Tier Role System**: SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, PLAYER
- 🔐 **Google OAuth Authentication**: Secure login via Google accounts
- 🔑 **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**: Service-to-service authentication
- 📧 **Email Invitations**: Admins invite players to specific leagues
- 🏢 **Multi-League Support**: Players can join multiple leagues

### Security & Deployment
- 🛡️ **Envoy Sidecar**: All traffic authenticated/authorized at proxy layer
- 🔒 **Zero-Trust Model**: API never exposed directly to internet
- 📦 **Kubernetes-Ready**: Three-service pod deployment (Envoy + Auth Service + Main API)
- 📈 **Production-Grade**: Rate limiting, monitoring, audit logging

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- MongoDB 6+
- Gradle 8.0+
- Docker (optional)

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/setup/superadmin \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pat_bootstrap_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "googleId": "google-oauth-id"
  }'
```

## Architecture

FFL Playoffs follows **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports & Adapters) for clean separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Infrastructure Layer                     │
│  (REST, Database, External APIs, Envoy)          │
│                     ↓ depends on                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Application Layer                        │
│  (Use Cases, DTOs, Port Interfaces)              │
│                     ↓ depends on                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Domain Layer (CORE)                      │
│  (Business Logic, Entities, Value Objects)       │
│         NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Three-Service Pod Model

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Kubernetes Pod                    │
│                                           │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │   Envoy Sidecar (Port 443)         │  │
│  │   - TLS termination                │  │
│  │   - External authorization         │  │
│  │   - Rate limiting                  │  │
│  └────────┬───────────────┬───────────┘  │
│           │               │               │
│  ┌────────▼──────┐   ┌───▼──────────┐   │
│  │ Auth Service  │   │  Main API    │   │
│  │ (Port 9191)   │   │ (Port 8080)  │   │
│  └───────────────┘   └──────────────┘   │
│                                           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Principles**:
- Envoy handles ALL authentication/authorization
- API focuses purely on business logic
- Auth service validates Google JWT and PAT tokens
- Zero-trust: API never directly exposed

#### 🔒 Post-Lock State (Season Active - Read-Only)
**After first game starts** - Rosters are PERMANENTLY LOCKED for entire season:

- **[Player Dashboard (Locked)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/egdcrypto/ffl-playoffs/blob/main/ui-design/mockups/player-dashboard-locked.html)** - Shows locked rosters, weekly scores, no edit options

- **[My Roster (Locked)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/egdcrypto/ffl-playoffs/blob/main/ui-design/mockups/my-roster-locked.html)** - Read-only roster view, weekly scoring, injured players remain (no replacements)
- **[League Standings (Locked)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/egdcrypto/ffl-playoffs/blob/main/ui-design/mockups/league-standings-locked.html)** - Final rankings with locked roster badges, live scoring

#### 🔐 Authentication
- **[Login Screen](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/egdcrypto/ffl-playoffs/blob/main/ui-design/mockups/login.html)** - Google OAuth authentication flow

**📊 ONE-TIME DRAFT Model:**
- **Pre-Lock Phase**: League players draft individual NFL players to fill all roster positions. Roster can be modified (add/drop players) until first game starts.
- **Post-Lock Phase**: Once the first NFL game starts, rosters are **PERMANENTLY LOCKED** for the entire season. NO waiver wire, NO trades, NO lineup changes, NO player replacements (even for injuries).
