Feature: Comprehensive Position-Specific Scoring with Configurable Rules
  As a fantasy football system
  I want to calculate fantasy points for all position types using configurable scoring rules
  So that each player type (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF) is scored correctly based on league configuration

  Background:
    Given the system calculates fantasy points based on league configuration
    And each position type has different scoring rules
    And all scoring rules are configurable by league admins

  # ==================== QUARTERBACK (QB) SCORING ====================

  Scenario: Calculate QB points with standard configuration
    Given a league has QB scoring configured as:
      | Stat                   | Points Per Unit |

      | Interception           | -2              |
      | Rushing yards          | 0.1 (1 per 10)  |
      | Rushing TD             | 6               |
      | Fumble lost            | -2              |
      | 2-pt conversion pass   | 2               |
      | 2-pt conversion rush   | 2               |
    And "Patrick Mahomes" has stats:
      | Stat               | Value |

    And a player slots "Cooper Kupp" (WR) in FLEX
    And "Cooper Kupp" has stats:
      | Receptions         | 9     |
      | Receiving yards    | 115   |

      | Receiving yards  | 115/10  | 11.5  |
      | Receiving TDs    | 1 × 6   | 6.0   |
    And total fantasy points = 26.5
    And FLEX doesn't have separate scoring rules

  # ==================== SUPERFLEX POSITION SCORING ====================

  Scenario: Superflex uses QB scoring when QB is slotted
    Given a league has Superflex position (QB/RB/WR/TE eligible)
    And a player slots "Geno Smith" (QB) in Superflex
    And "Geno Smith" has stats:
      | Passing yards      | 250   |
      | Passing TDs        | 2     |
      | Interceptions      | 1     |

      | Rushing TD              | 0     |
    When the configuration is validated
    Then the system rejects negative yards per point
    And the system warns about 0-point touchdowns
    And the configuration is not saved

  Scenario: Admin can configure zero penalty for negative plays
    Given an admin wants forgiving scoring with no penalties
    When the admin configures:
      | Interception    | 0     |
      | Fumble lost     | 0     |
      | Missed FG 0-39  | 0     |

    Given "Player X" is listed as QB
    And has stats:
      | Passing yards      | 200   |
      | Passing TDs        | 2     |
      | Receptions         | 1     |
      | Receiving yards    | 3     |
      | Receiving TDs      | 1     |
    When fantasy points are calculated
    Then all stats are counted:
      | Passing yards    | 200/25  | 8.0   |
      | Passing TDs      | 2 × 4   | 8.0   |
      | Receptions       | 1 × 1   | 1.0   |
      | Receiving yards  | 3/10    | 0.3   |
      | Receiving TDs    | 1 × 6   | 6.0   |
    And total fantasy points = 23.3

  Scenario: Zero stat performance (DNP - Did Not Play)
    Given "Injured Player" has all stats at 0
    When fantasy points are calculated
    Then total fantasy points = 0.0
    And the player contributed nothing to roster

  Scenario: Stat correction changes calculated points
    Given "Player Y" was originally credited with stats:
      | Rushing yards      | 105   |
      | Rushing TDs        | 2     |
    And original fantasy points = 22.5
    When NFL issues stat correction:
      | Rushing yards      | 98    |
      | Rushing TDs        | 1     |
    Then new fantasy points are calculated:
      | Rushing yards    | 98/10  | 9.8   |
      | Rushing TDs      | 1 × 6  | 6.0   |
    And new total = 15.8
    And the difference of -6.7 points is applied

  # ==================== EDGE CASES ====================

  Scenario: Fractional stat values are rounded correctly
    Given "Player Z" has stats:
      | Rushing yards      | 107   |
      | Receiving yards    | 83    |
    When fantasy points are calculated
    Then the scoring is:
      | Rushing yards    | 107/10  | 10.7  |
      | Receiving yards  | 83/10   | 8.3   |
    And total fantasy points = 19.0 (to 1 decimal place)

  Scenario: Extremely high stat totals
    Given "Record-Breaking Player" has stats:
      | Passing yards      | 554   |
      | Passing TDs        | 7     |
    When fantasy points are calculated
    Then the scoring is:
      | Passing yards  | 554/25  | 22.16 |
      | Passing TDs    | 7 × 4   | 28.0  |
    And total fantasy points = 50.16
    And the system handles record-breaking performances

  Scenario: All negative stats (worst possible performance)
    Given "Worst Performance" has stats:
      | Passing yards      | 50    |
      | Interceptions      | 5     |
      | Fumbles lost       | 3     |
      | Sacks taken        | 8     |
    When fantasy points are calculated
    Then the scoring is:
      | Passing yards  | 50/25   | 2.0   |
      | Interceptions  | 5 × -2  | -10.0 |
      | Fumbles lost   | 3 × -2  | -6.0  |
    And total fantasy points = -14.0
    And the system correctly handles net negative scores
