Feature: League Creation and Configuration
  As an admin
  I want to create and configure fantasy football leagues
  So that players can participate in customized competitions

  Background:
    Given a user with ADMIN role exists
    And the admin is authenticated

  Scenario: Admin creates basic league with default configuration
    When the admin creates a new league with:
      | Field              | Value                |
      | Name               | Championship 2024    |
      | Description        | Season playoff pool  |
      | Starting Week      | 1                    |
      | Number of Weeks    | 4                    |
      | Max Players        | 20                   |
      | Privacy            | PRIVATE              |
    Then a new league is created with id "league-123"
    And the league owner is set to the admin
    And the league status is "DRAFT"
    And the league uses default roster configuration
    And the league uses default PPR scoring rules

  Scenario: Admin configures custom roster structure
    When the admin creates a league with custom roster configuration:
      | Position   | Count |
      | QB         | 1     |
      | RB         | 3     |
      | WR         | 3     |
      | TE         | 1     |
      | FLEX       | 2     |

      | DEF        | 1     |
      | Superflex  | 1     |
    Then the league total roster size is 13 positions
    And each position slot is defined with eligible positions
    And the FLEX slot accepts RB, WR, or TE
    And the Superflex slot accepts QB, RB, WR, or TE

  Scenario: Admin sets league to start at NFL week 15 (playoffs)

    And the league runs through NFL weeks 8-13
    And the system validates: 8 + 6 - 1 = 13 â‰¤ 22

  Scenario: Admin attempts to create league exceeding NFL season
    When the admin attempts to create a league with:
      | Starting Week   | 18 |
      | Number of Weeks | 6  |

      | Reception (PPR)           | 0.5  |
      | Receiving TD              | 6    |
