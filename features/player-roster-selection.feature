Feature: Player Roster Selection and Draft System (ONE-TIME DRAFT MODEL)
  As a league player
  I want to build my roster by drafting individual NFL players ONCE before the season
  So that I can compete with my locked roster for the entire season

  CRITICAL RULE: This is a ONE-TIME DRAFT MODEL
  - Rosters are built ONCE before the first game starts
  - Once the first game starts, rosters are PERMANENTLY LOCKED
  - NO changes allowed after lock: no waiver wire, no trades, no weekly adjustments
  - League players compete with their locked rosters for all configured weeks

  Background:
    Given the league "2025 Playoffs League" exists
    And the league has the following roster configuration:
      | position   | count | eligiblePositions      |
      | QB         | 1     | QB                     |
      | RB         | 2     | RB                     |
      | WR         | 2     | WR                     |
      | TE         | 1     | TE                     |
      | K          | 1     | K                      |
      | DEF        | 1     | DEF                    |
      | FLEX       | 1     | RB,WR,TE               |
      | SUPERFLEX  | 1     | QB,RB,WR,TE            |
    And the league has 12 league players
    And I am authenticated as league player "john_player"
    And the following NFL players exist:
      | id  | name              | position | team |
      | 101 | Patrick Mahomes   | QB       | KC   |
      | 102 | Josh Allen        | QB       | BUF  |
      | 103 | Christian McCaffrey| RB      | SF   |
      | 104 | Derrick Henry     | RB       | BAL  |
