Feature: Team Selection
  As a player
  I want to select NFL teams for each week
  So that I can compete in the 4-week playoff game

  Background:
    Given the game "2025 NFL Playoffs Pool" is active
    And the game has 4 weeks configured
    And I am authenticated as player "john_player"

  Scenario: Player successfully selects a team for the current week
    Given it is week 1 of the game
    And the pick deadline for week 1 is "2025-10-05 13:00:00"
    And the current time is "2025-10-05 10:00:00"
    And the team "Kansas City Chiefs" is available
    When I select team "Kansas City Chiefs" for week 1
    Then my selection should be saved successfully
    And my pick for week 1 should be "Kansas City Chiefs"
    And the team "Kansas City Chiefs" should be marked as used by me

  Scenario: Player cannot select the same team twice across their own weeks
    Given I selected "Dallas Cowboys" for week 1
    And it is now week 2 of the game
    And the pick deadline for week 2 is "2025-10-12 13:00:00"
    And the current time is "2025-10-12 10:00:00"
    And other players may have also selected "Dallas Cowboys" for their weeks
    When I attempt to select team "Dallas Cowboys" for week 2
    Then the selection should fail
    And I should receive error "You have already selected this team in week 1"
    And my pick for week 2 should remain unset
    But other players can still select "Dallas Cowboys" for any of their weeks

  Scenario: Player updates pick before deadline
    Given it is week 1 of the game
    And I selected "Buffalo Bills" for week 1
    And the pick deadline for week 1 is "2025-10-05 13:00:00"
    And the current time is "2025-10-05 11:00:00"
    When I update my week 1 pick to "San Francisco 49ers"
    Then my selection should be updated successfully
    And my pick for week 1 should be "San Francisco 49ers"
    And the team "Buffalo Bills" should no longer be marked as used by me

  Scenario: Player cannot make selection after deadline
    Given it is week 2 of the game
    And the pick deadline for week 2 is "2025-10-12 13:00:00"
    And the current time is "2025-10-12 13:01:00"
    When I attempt to select team "Miami Dolphins" for week 2
    Then the selection should fail
    And I should receive error "Pick deadline has passed for week 2"

  Scenario: Player cannot modify pick after deadline
    Given it is week 1 of the game
    And I selected "Philadelphia Eagles" for week 1
    And the pick deadline for week 1 is "2025-10-05 13:00:00"
    And the current time is "2025-10-05 13:30:00"
    When I attempt to update my week 1 pick to "Green Bay Packers"
    Then the update should fail
    And I should receive error "Pick deadline has passed for week 1"
    And my pick for week 1 should remain "Philadelphia Eagles"

  Scenario: Player views all NFL teams for selection
    Given it is week 2 of the game
    And I have selected the following teams:
      | week | team              |
      | 1    | Dallas Cowboys    |
    When I request teams for week 2 selection
    Then I should see all 32 NFL teams
    And "Dallas Cowboys" should be marked as "already used by me"
    And other teams should be marked as "available"
    And all teams should display their current season record
    And all teams should display their upcoming opponent
    And teams used by other players should still be selectable

  Scenario: Player makes selections for all 4 weeks
    Given the game allows advance picks
    And no deadlines have passed
    When I select the following teams:
      | week | team                  |
      | 1    | Kansas City Chiefs    |
      | 2    | Buffalo Bills         |
      | 3    | San Francisco 49ers   |
      | 4    | Dallas Cowboys        |
    Then all 4 selections should be saved successfully
    And I should have 4 teams marked as used

  Scenario: Player cannot select teams for future weeks if advance picks are disabled
    Given it is week 1 of the game
    And the game does not allow advance picks
    When I attempt to select team "Denver Broncos" for week 3
    Then the selection should fail
    And I should receive error "Cannot make selections for future weeks"

  Scenario: Player receives reminder before pick deadline
    Given it is week 2 of the game
    And I have not made a selection for week 2
    And the pick deadline for week 2 is "2025-10-12 13:00:00"
    And the current time is "2025-10-12 11:00:00"
    And reminder notifications are enabled
    Then I should receive a reminder notification
    And the reminder should indicate "2 hours remaining to make your pick"

  Scenario: Player with eliminated team can still pick for remaining weeks
    Given it is week 3 of the game
    And I selected "Tampa Bay Buccaneers" for week 1
    And the "Tampa Bay Buccaneers" lost their game in week 1
    And the "Tampa Bay Buccaneers" are eliminated for me
    When I select team "Baltimore Ravens" for week 3
    Then my selection should be saved successfully
    And my pick for week 3 should be "Baltimore Ravens"

  Scenario: Player views their selection history
    Given I have made the following selections:
      | week | team                  | status      |
      | 1    | Kansas City Chiefs    | WON         |
      | 2    | Buffalo Bills         | LOST        |
      | 3    | San Francisco 49ers   | PENDING     |
    When I request my team selection history
    Then I should receive 3 selections
    And each selection should show the team name, week, and game outcome

  Scenario: Player cannot select a team that doesn't exist
    Given it is week 1 of the game
    When I attempt to select team "Invalid Team Name" for week 1
    Then the selection should fail
    And I should receive error "Team not found"

  Scenario: Player cannot make selection for completed week
    Given week 1 is completed
    And I did not make a selection for week 1
    When I attempt to select team "Atlanta Falcons" for week 1
    Then the selection should fail
    And I should receive error "Cannot make selection for completed week"

  Scenario: Player who misses a week deadline gets zero points
    Given it is week 2 of the game
    And I did not make a selection for week 1
    And week 1 is now completed
    Then my score for week 1 should be 0
    And I should be able to make selections for remaining weeks

  Scenario Outline: Team selection validation across 4 weeks
    Given the game has 4 weeks configured
    And I have made the following selections:
      | week | team   |
      | 1    | <team1> |
      | 2    | <team2> |
      | 3    | <team3> |
    When I attempt to select team "<team4>" for week 4
    Then the selection should <result>
    And I should receive <feedback>

    Examples:
      | team1            | team2             | team3               | team4               | result  | feedback                                        |
      | Chiefs           | Bills             | 49ers               | Cowboys             | succeed | selection saved successfully                    |
      | Chiefs           | Bills             | 49ers               | Chiefs              | fail    | error "Team already selected in week 1"         |
      | Chiefs           | Bills             | 49ers               | Bills               | fail    | error "Team already selected in week 2"         |
      | Chiefs           | Bills             | 49ers               | 49ers               | fail    | error "Team already selected in week 3"         |

  Scenario: Multiple players can independently select the same team
    Given player "player1" selected "Dallas Cowboys" for week 1
    And player "player2" selected "Dallas Cowboys" for week 1
    And player "player3" selected "Dallas Cowboys" for week 1
    And I am player "player4"
    And it is week 1 of the game
    When I select team "Dallas Cowboys" for week 1
    Then my selection should be saved successfully
    And my pick for week 1 should be "Dallas Cowboys"
    And all 4 players have independently selected "Dallas Cowboys"
    And there is no limit on how many players can pick the same team

  Scenario: NOT a draft system - all teams always available to all players
    Given the league has 10 players
    And it is week 2 of the game
    And 5 players have already selected "Kansas City Chiefs" for week 2
    When I view the available teams
    Then I should see all 32 NFL teams listed
    And "Kansas City Chiefs" should be marked as "available"
    And I should be able to select "Kansas City Chiefs" even though 5 others picked it
    And there is NO concept of team availability based on other players' picks
    And each player makes independent selections without affecting others

  Scenario: Player views pick deadline countdown
    Given it is week 1 of the game
    And the pick deadline for week 1 is "2025-10-05 13:00:00"
    And the current time is "2025-10-05 11:30:00"
    When I request the current week information
    Then I should receive deadline information
    And the time remaining should be "1 hour 30 minutes"
    And the deadline status should be "OPEN"
