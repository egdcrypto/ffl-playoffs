## Overview

### Product Description
A Fantasy Football League game where players build rosters by selecting individual NFL players across multiple positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DEF, Superflex) for a configurable duration (1-17 weeks, default 4 weeks) starting at any week of the NFL season (weeks 1-22). Admins configure roster structure (how many of each position) and scoring rules. Uses standard PPR (Points Per Reception) scoring with configurable field goal and defensive scoring.

### Key Differentiators
- **Configurable Roster Positions**: Admins define roster structure with flexible position counts (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DEF, Superflex)
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Start at any NFL week (1-22), run for any duration (1-17 weeks)
- **League-Scoped Players**: Players belong to specific leagues, supporting multi-league participation
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Envoy sidecar with custom auth service, Google OAuth, and PATs
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability and testability

## System Architecture
- **API**: Headless Java-based REST API
- **Architecture Pattern**: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Envoy sidecar proxy in the same pod as the API
- **API Access**: ALL API access is ONLY through Envoy sidecar (no direct API exposure)
- **Security Model**: API listens only on localhost, Envoy handles all external traffic
- **Data Integration**: Near real-time data pulling from external datasources

## Core Features

### 1. User Management and Role Hierarchy

#### Role System
The system implements a three-tier role hierarchy:

1. **SUPER_ADMIN**
   - System-wide administrator
   - Can invite and create ADMIN accounts
   - Can revoke admin access
   - Can view and manage all leagues across the system
   - Has full system access
   - Cannot be created through invitation (bootstrapped via configuration)

2. **ADMIN**
   - League administrators (invite-only)
   - Can be created only by SUPER_ADMIN invitation
   - Can create and manage their own leagues
   - Can configure league settings
   - Can invite PLAYER accounts to their leagues
   - Has league-scoped permissions

3. **PLAYER**

### 2. Roster Building and Player Selection
- **Individual NFL Player Selection by Position**
  - **IMPORTANT**: League players build rosters by selecting individual NFL players (e.g., "Patrick Mahomes", "Christian McCaffrey")
  - This is traditional fantasy football roster management with position-based selection
  - Roster structure configured by admin (e.g., 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 K, 1 DEF, 1 Superflex)
  - Each roster slot has position requirements:
    - **QB (Quarterback)**: Must select NFL quarterback
    - **RB (Running Back)**: Must select NFL running back
    - **WR (Wide Receiver)**: Must select NFL wide receiver
    - **TE (Tight End)**: Must select NFL tight end
    - **K (Kicker)**: Must select NFL kicker
    - **DEF (Defense/Special Teams)**: Must select NFL team defense
    - **FLEX**: Can select RB, WR, or TE
    - **Superflex**: Can select QB, RB, WR, or TE

- **Player Search and Filtering**
  - Search NFL players by name
  - Filter by position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF)
  - Filter by NFL team (32 teams)
  - View player stats (game-by-game performance)
  - View player season totals and averages
  - Sort by various stats (points, yards, touchdowns, etc.)
  - Pagination support for large player lists

  - View current roster with all filled positions
  - Edit roster selections before deadline
  - Selection deadline before games start each week (configurable)
  - Roster validation ensures all positions are filled with eligible players
  - View game-by-game scoring breakdown for each selected player
  - Number of weeks determined by league configuration (1-17 weeks)

### 3. Scoring System
- **PPR Scoring Rules (Team-Based)**
  - **IMPORTANT**: Scoring is based on the ENTIRE NFL TEAM's cumulative offensive performance
  - Standard PPR (Points Per Reception) scoring
  - Touchdowns: 6 points (all team TDs)
  - Receptions: 1 point per reception (all team receptions)
  - Passing yards: 1 point per 25 yards (team total passing)
  - Rushing/Receiving yards: 1 point per 10 yards (team totals)
  - Extra Points: 1 point
  - Two-Point Conversions: 2 points
  - Example: If "Kansas City Chiefs" throw for 300 yards, rush for 120 yards, have 25 receptions, and score 4 TDs, the player who selected them gets all those points

- **Field Goal Scoring (Configurable by Distance)**
  - Admin can configure points by distance range
  - Default scoring:
    - 0-39 yards: 3 points
    - 40-49 yards: 4 points
    - 50+ yards: 5 points
  - Each league can customize these values
  - Game results track field goal distance for accurate scoring

- **Defensive Scoring (Configurable)**
  - Admin can configure all defensive scoring rules
  - Default defensive scoring:
    - Sacks: 1 point
    - Interceptions: 2 points
    - Fumble Recovery: 2 points
    - Safety: 2 points
    - Defensive/Special Teams TD: 6 points

  - **Points Allowed Scoring Tiers** (configurable):
    - 0 points allowed: 10 points
    - 1-6 points allowed: 7 points
    - 7-13 points allowed: 4 points
    - 14-20 points allowed: 1 point
    - 21-27 points allowed: 0 points
    - 28-34 points allowed: -1 point
    - 35+ points allowed: -4 points

  - **Total Yards Allowed Scoring Tiers** (configurable):
    - 0-99 yards allowed: 10 points
    - 100-199 yards allowed: 7 points
    - 200-299 yards allowed: 5 points
    - 300-349 yards allowed: 3 points
    - 350-399 yards allowed: 0 points
    - 400-449 yards allowed: -3 points
    - 450+ yards allowed: -5 points

  - **Total Defensive Points Calculation**:
    - Sum of: individual defensive plays + points allowed tier + yards allowed tier
    - Example: 3 sacks (3 pts) + 1 INT (2 pts) + 10 points allowed (7 pts) + 250 yards allowed (5 pts) = 17 fantasy points

  - Each league can customize all defensive scoring rules and tiers

- **Elimination Rules**
  - If a player's selected team loses, that team is "eliminated"
  - Eliminated teams score ZERO points for all remaining weeks
  - Player can still pick other non-eliminated teams in future weeks
  - Track team win/loss status per week

### 4. League/Game Creation and Configuration
- **Admin League Setup**
  - Admins can create new leagues/games
  - Configure league settings:
    - League name and description
    - Start date and end date
    - Starting NFL week (1-18, default: 1) - which week of NFL season to begin
    - Number of weeks (configurable: 1-17 weeks, default: 4)
    - Validation: startingWeek + numberOfWeeks - 1 â‰¤ 18 (cannot exceed NFL season)

### 8. Authentication & Authorization

- **Envoy Sidecar Security Model**
  - Envoy handles ALL authentication and authorization via External Authorization (ext_authz) filter
  - Custom authentication service validates tokens
  - Supports two authentication methods:
    - Google OAuth JWT tokens for user authentication (users, admins, players)
    - Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for service-to-service communication
  - Envoy calls auth service to validate ALL requests
  - Auth service detects token type and validates accordingly
  - Role-based access control enforced by Envoy based on auth service response
  - Unauthenticated requests blocked at sidecar (401 Unauthorized)
  - Unauthorized role access blocked at sidecar (403 Forbidden)
  - API receives pre-validated requests with user context headers

- **Envoy Authentication Plugin Architecture**
  - Envoy ext_authz filter configured to call authentication service
  - Authentication service runs in same pod (localhost:9191)
  - For each request, Envoy extracts Authorization header and calls auth service
  - Auth service detects token type:
    - Token starts with `pat_` prefix â†’ PAT validation
    - Otherwise â†’ Google JWT validation
  - Auth service returns HTTP 200 (authorized) with headers or HTTP 403 (forbidden)
  - Envoy forwards request to API only if auth service approves

- **Google OAuth Authentication Flow (Human Users)**
  1. User authenticates with Google Sign-In (frontend)
  2. Frontend receives Google JWT token
  3. Client sends request with Google JWT in Authorization header: `Bearer <google-jwt>`
  4. Envoy calls auth service with the token
  5. Auth service validates Google JWT signature using Google's public keys
  6. Auth service validates JWT expiration and issuer (accounts.google.com)
  7. Auth service extracts user email/Google ID from JWT claims
  8. Auth service queries database to find User by googleId and get role
  9. Auth service returns HTTP 200 with headers: X-User-Id, X-User-Email, X-User-Role, X-Google-Id
  10. Envoy checks role against endpoint requirements
  11. If authorized, Envoy forwards request to API with user context headers
  12. API processes pre-authenticated request

- **User Account Creation Flow**
  1. Admin sends invitation to player email for specific league
  2. Player receives invitation link
  3. Player clicks link and authenticates with Google OAuth
  4. System checks if user exists by Google ID
  5. If new user: create account with Google ID, email, name from Google profile
  6. Link player to the specific league they were invited to
  7. Player can now access league with Google authentication

- **PAT Authentication Flow (Service-to-Service)**
  1. Service sends request with PAT in Authorization header: `Bearer pat_<token>`
  2. Envoy calls auth service with the PAT
  3. Auth service detects PAT prefix (`pat_`)
  4. Auth service hashes the PAT and queries PersonalAccessToken table
  5. Auth service validates PAT is not expired and not revoked
  6. Auth service extracts PAT scope and service identifier
  7. Auth service returns HTTP 200 with headers: X-Service-Id, X-PAT-Scope, X-PAT-Id
  8. Auth service updates lastUsedAt timestamp for PAT
  9. Envoy checks PAT scope against endpoint requirements
  10. If authorized, Envoy forwards request to API with service context headers
  11. API processes pre-authenticated service request

- **Endpoint Security Requirements**
  - `/api/v1/superadmin/*` - Requires SUPER_ADMIN role OR PAT with ADMIN scope (enforced by Envoy)
  - `/api/v1/admin/*` - Requires ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN role OR PAT with WRITE/ADMIN scope (enforced by Envoy)
  - `/api/v1/player/*` - Requires any authenticated user OR PAT with any scope (enforced by Envoy)
  - `/api/v1/public/*` - No authentication required
  - `/api/v1/service/*` - Requires valid PAT only (service-to-service endpoints)

- **Authorization Rules**
  - SUPER_ADMIN: Full system access, all endpoints
  - ADMIN: League-scoped access, can only manage their own leagues
  - PLAYER: Read-only league data, write access only to their own picks
  - Endpoint-level role validation by Envoy
  - Resource ownership validation in API business logic
  - Token refresh mechanism handled by Envoy

## Technical Requirements

### API Design
- **RESTful API**
  - Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - JSON request/response format
  - Versioned endpoints (/api/v1/...)
  - Consistent error handling
  - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

- **API Deployment Model**
  - Three services in the same Kubernetes pod:
    1. Main API (localhost:8080) - Business logic
    2. Auth Service (localhost:9191) - Token validation for Envoy
    3. Envoy Sidecar (pod IP:443) - External entry point
  - Main API listens ONLY on localhost:8080 (not externally accessible)
  - Auth service listens ONLY on localhost:9191 (called by Envoy ext_authz)
  - Envoy sidecar listens on pod IP (externally accessible)
  - All external requests go through Envoy â†’ Auth Service â†’ Main API
  - Network policies prevent direct API/Auth service access
  - API and Auth service completely protected behind Envoy proxy
  - No way to bypass Envoy authentication/authorization
