### ‚ùå Engineer 2 (Project Structure): CHANGES REQUIRED
**Status**: Database configuration must be fixed before approval
**Review Report**: `engineer-2-project-structure-review-20251002.md`

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ Perfect hexagonal architecture implementation
- ‚úÖ Domain model correctly implements NO ownership model
- ‚úÖ League-scoped membership via LeaguePlayer junction table
- ‚úÖ Individual NFL player selection with position validation
- ‚úÖ Roster locking mechanism for one-time draft
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns (domain, application, infrastructure)
- ‚úÖ Domain layer has no framework dependencies

**Critical Issue**:
- ‚ùå **Database Configuration Mismatch**
  - Requirements specify: MongoDB 6+
  - Current configuration: PostgreSQL with JPA/Hibernate
  - `build.gradle:27` - Uses spring-boot-starter-data-jpa (for relational databases)
  - `build.gradle:33` - Has PostgreSQL runtime dependency
  - `application.yml:6-18` - PostgreSQL JDBC + JPA/Hibernate configuration

**Required Fixes**:
1. Remove PostgreSQL dependency from `build.gradle` (line 33)
2. Remove `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` from `build.gradle` (line 27)
3. Replace `application.yml` PostgreSQL/JPA config with MongoDB config:
   ```yaml
   spring:
     data:
       mongodb:
         uri: ${MONGODB_URI:mongodb://localhost:27017/ffl_playoffs}
         database: ffl_playoffs
   ```
4. Verify all `*MongoRepository` implementations use Spring Data MongoDB annotations
5. Test MongoDB connection and data persistence

**Action**: Message sent to Engineer 2 with fix instructions

## Recommendations

### For Engineering Team

1. **Engineer 2**: Fix database configuration immediately - this is a blocker
2. **Engineer 3**: Complete ARCHITECTURE.md updates and commit all changes
3. **All Engineers**: Review uncommitted changes and commit with proper messages
4. **All Engineers**: Prepare for BDD test implementation phase

### For Project Success

1. **Maintain Consistency**: Keep code, docs, and features aligned
2. **Use Documentation as Reference**: docs/ folder is the authoritative source
3. **Follow Hexagonal Architecture**: Continue excellent architecture patterns
4. **Test with MongoDB**: Ensure all persistence works with MongoDB 6+

### For Product Manager (Me)

1. Continue monitoring work queue for new assignments
2. Re-review Engineer 2 deliverables after database fix
3. Verify ARCHITECTURE.md updates are complete
4. Coordinate next phase of development (BDD tests, API implementation)

---

## Conclusion

**The FFL Playoffs project is in GOOD shape with 3 out of 4 engineering teams delivering APPROVED work.** The feature files, documentation, and UI/UX deliverables are excellent and comprehensive.

**ONE CRITICAL ISSUE remains**: The database configuration must be changed from PostgreSQL to MongoDB to meet requirements. This is a blocker for application functionality and must be resolved immediately.

Once the database configuration is fixed and ARCHITECTURE.md updates are complete, the project will be ready to proceed to the implementation phase (BDD tests, API endpoints, integration tests).

**Overall Assessment**: üü° GOOD (pending critical database fix)
