**File**: features/player-invitation.feature (170 lines)

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **APPROVED - ALL SCENARIOS PROPERLY LEAGUE-SCOPED**

All 19 scenarios in player-invitation.feature are correctly scoped to specific leagues and fully comply with requirements.md:100-110. The file implements league-scoped invitations with proper authorization, multi-league membership, and LeaguePlayer junction table creation.

**Compliance Score**: 19/19 scenarios (100%)

## 1. Feature Header Review

### Line 1-4: Feature Declaration ✅
```gherkin
Feature: Player Invitation (League-Scoped)
  As an admin
  I want to invite players to join specific leagues I own
  So that we can build competitive leagues with authorized participants
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Title explicitly states "League-Scoped"
- ✅ User story specifies "specific leagues I own" (not "the game")
- ✅ Business value mentions "leagues" (plural)
- ✅ Clearly indicates admin ownership requirement

**Status**: PASS

## 2. Background Setup Review

### Line 6-12: Background Context ✅
```gherkin
Background:

    | leagueId  | leagueName                |
    | league-01 | 2025 NFL Playoffs Pool    |
    | league-02 | Championship Challenge    |
```

- ✅ Admin has unique identifier (admin-001)

## 11. Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Original - Non-Compliant)
```gherkin

Then the player should be added to the game
```
- ❌ No league context
- ❌ No LeaguePlayer junction

- ❌ No multi-league support

### After (Current - Fully Compliant)
```gherkin
When I send an invitation to "john.doe@email.com" for league "league-01"
And a LeaguePlayer junction record should be created linking:
  | userId     | leagueId  | role   |
  | user-jane  | league-01 | PLAYER |
```
- ✅ Explicit league scope
- ✅ Junction table implementation
- ✅ Admin ownership enforced
- ✅ Multi-league membership
