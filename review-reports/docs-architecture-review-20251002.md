# Architecture Documentation Review
**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Work ID**: WORK-20251002-115559-1401978
**Reviewer**: Documentation Engineer
**Document**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Last Commit**: 4c6dbab - "docs: consolidate ARCHITECTURE.md into comprehensive docs/ version"

---

## Executive Summary

The `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` file is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides excellent coverage of the FFL Playoffs hexagonal architecture. However, there are several **minor discrepancies** between the documentation and the actual codebase implementation that should be addressed to ensure accuracy.

**Overall Assessment**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED with Minor Corrections Needed**

---

## Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Excellent explanation of hexagonal architecture principles
   - Detailed sections on all three layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)
   - Security architecture with Envoy sidecar well-documented
   - Configuration immutability business rule thoroughly explained
   - Good code examples throughout

2. **Structure and Organization**
   - Clear table of contents with 10 major sections
   - Logical flow from overview to implementation details
   - Well-formatted with diagrams and code samples
   - Cross-references to other documentation files

3. **Technical Accuracy**
   - Technology stack correctly documented (Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2.1, MongoDB)
   - Dependency rules properly explained
   - Ports and adapters pattern well illustrated
   - Configuration lock mechanism matches implementation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Discrepancies Found

#### 1. Domain Services - Mentioned but Not Implemented

**Issue**: Documentation references domain services that don't exist in the codebase.

**Documentation Claims** (lines 98-100, 519-522):
```
Domain Services:
- EliminationService       ‚ùå NOT FOUND
- ScoringService          ‚úÖ EXISTS
- TeamSelectionValidator  ‚ùå NOT FOUND
```

**Actual Implementation**:
- `ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/domain/service/ScoringService.java` ‚úÖ
- No `EliminationService.java` found
- No `TeamSelectionValidator.java` found (validators only in infrastructure/auth layer)

**Impact**: Medium - Documentation describes domain services that don't exist

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Remove references to `EliminationService` and `TeamSelectionValidator` from documentation, OR
2. Create these domain services if they are planned architecture

---

#### 2. Domain Events - Incomplete Implementation

**Issue**: Documentation references domain events that don't exist.

**Documentation Claims** (lines 103-108, 659, 684, 705):
```
Domain Events:
- TeamEliminatedEvent           ‚úÖ EXISTS
- TeamSelectedEvent             ‚ùå NOT FOUND
- ScoreCalculatedEvent          ‚ùå NOT FOUND
- GameCreatedEvent              ‚úÖ EXISTS
- LeagueConfigurationLockedEvent ‚ùå NOT FOUND (mentioned in section)
```

**Actual Implementation**:
```bash
ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/domain/event/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GameCreatedEvent.java         ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TeamEliminatedEvent.java      ‚úÖ
```

**Impact**: Medium - Documentation describes event-driven architecture that's partially implemented

**Recommendation**:
1. Update documentation to only list `GameCreatedEvent` and `TeamEliminatedEvent` as implemented events
2. Add note that additional events are planned for future implementation
3. OR implement the missing events if they're required

---

#### 3. Use Case Naming Inconsistency

**Issue**: Documentation uses different name than actual implementation.

**Documentation** (line 64, 176):
- References `MakeTeamSelectionUseCase`

**Actual Implementation**:
- File is named `SelectTeamUseCase.java`
- Class is `SelectTeamUseCase`

**Impact**: Low - Minor naming inconsistency

**Recommendation**: Update documentation to use `SelectTeamUseCase` consistently

---

#### 4. Aggregate Terminology - Game vs League

**Issue**: Documentation sometimes uses "Game" and sometimes "League" as aggregate root.

**Documentation**:
- Line 479-487: "League Aggregate" with League as root
- Line 974-999: Code examples showing `Game` class with configuration lock methods

**Actual Implementation**:
- Both `Game.java` and `League.java` exist as separate entities
- Both have configuration lock fields
- Documentation should clarify the distinction

**Impact**: Low - Potential confusion about aggregate boundaries

**Recommendation**: Add clarification:
- When to use `Game` vs `League`
- How they relate to each other
- Whether they're separate aggregates or one is a child of the other

---

### ‚úÖ Verified Accurate

1. **Configuration Immutability** ‚úÖ
   - Game.java:90-131 implements `isConfigurationLocked()`, `validateConfigurationMutable()`
   - League.java:36-39 has lock fields: `configurationLocked`, `configurationLockedAt`, `lockReason`, `firstGameStartTime`
   - Implementation matches documentation exactly

2. **Hexagonal Architecture Structure** ‚úÖ
   - Domain layer: `ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/domain/` (no framework deps)
   - Application layer: `ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/application/`
   - Infrastructure layer: `ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/infrastructure/`

3. **Domain Models** ‚úÖ
   - All mentioned models exist: Game, Player, TeamSelection, Week, Score, User, League, NFLGame, NFLPlayer, etc.

4. **Use Cases** ‚úÖ
   - 29 use cases implemented including CreateGameUseCase, InvitePlayerUseCase, SelectTeamUseCase, CalculateScoresUseCase

5. **REST Controllers** ‚úÖ
   - All mentioned controllers exist: GameController, PlayerController, AdminController, LeaderboardController, etc.

6. **Build Configuration** ‚úÖ
   - build.gradle matches documentation (Spring Boot 3.2.1, MongoDB, Lombok, Cucumber, etc.)

7. **Security Architecture** ‚úÖ
   - Auth service exists: `ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/infrastructure/auth/`
   - SecurityConfig exists: `ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/infrastructure/config/SecurityConfig.java`

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: High Priority Corrections

1. **Update Domain Services Section** (lines 98-100, 519-528)
   ```markdown
   Domain Services:
   - ScoringService - Core scoring logic implementation

   Note: EliminationService and TeamSelectionValidator are planned for future implementation.
   Elimination logic is currently handled within domain entities.
   ```

2. **Update Domain Events Section** (lines 103-108)
   ```markdown
   Domain Events:
   - GameCreatedEvent - Emitted when a new game is created
   - TeamEliminatedEvent - Emitted when a team is eliminated

   Planned Events:
   - TeamSelectedEvent (future)
   - ScoreCalculatedEvent (future)
   - LeagueConfigurationLockedEvent (future)
   ```

### Priority 2: Medium Priority Improvements

3. **Clarify Game vs League Aggregates**
   - Add section explaining relationship between Game and League entities
   - Update examples to use consistent terminology
   - Consider if one should be renamed for clarity

4. **Fix Use Case Naming**
   - Change `MakeTeamSelectionUseCase` ‚Üí `SelectTeamUseCase` throughout document

### Priority 3: Low Priority Enhancements

5. **Add "Current vs Planned Architecture" Section**
   - Document which components are implemented vs planned
   - Helps readers understand evolution of the architecture

6. **Update Data Flow Examples** (lines 692-712)
   - Team Elimination Flow references `EliminationService` which doesn't exist
   - Update to show actual implementation (likely in domain entities or ScoringService)

## Conclusion

The `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` file is **high quality** and provides excellent architectural documentation. The discrepancies found are relatively minor and primarily involve:

1. References to domain services that haven't been implemented yet
2. References to domain events that are planned but not yet created
3. Minor naming inconsistencies

**Action Items**:
1. ‚úÖ Update documentation to reflect actual implementation
2. üîÑ OR implement the missing components if they're required
3. ‚úÖ Add notes distinguishing implemented vs. planned features

**Status**: APPROVED with minor corrections recommended

---

**Next Steps**:
- Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md based on Priority 1 and Priority 2 recommendations
- Consider adding ROADMAP.md to track planned vs implemented features
- Re-review after corrections applied
