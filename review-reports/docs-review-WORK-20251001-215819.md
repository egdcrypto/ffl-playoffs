**Work ID**: WORK-20251001-215819-2902287
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Reviewer**: Documentation Engineer
**Files Reviewed**:
- docs/API.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/domain-model-validation.md

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

The reviewed documentation contains **significant inconsistencies** with the requirements.md and feature files. The documents mix the **OLD team-based model** (selecting entire NFL teams) with the **CORRECT roster-based model** (selecting individual NFL players by position).

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **API.md**: Contains incorrect "team selection" endpoints from old model
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Uses "TeamSelection" entity instead of Roster/RosterSelection
3. **domain-model-validation.md**: Missing roster lock validation rules

---

## Issue #1: API.md - Mixed Domain Models ‚ùå

### Problem
The API.md document contains endpoints for **TWO DIFFERENT GAME MODELS** which creates confusion:

#### OLD Model (Incorrect) - Lines 577-628
```
POST /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/selections
{
  "week": 1,
  "teamName": "Kansas City Chiefs"
}
```
This endpoint suggests players select entire NFL **teams** for each week.

#### CORRECT Model - Lines 829-1035
```
POST /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/roster/slots/{slotId}/assign
{
  "nflPlayerId": 1001
}
```
This endpoint correctly allows players to build **rosters** with individual NFL players.

### Requirements.md States (Section 2)
> "League players build rosters by selecting individual NFL players (e.g., 'Patrick Mahomes', 'Christian McCaffrey')"
> "This is traditional fantasy football roster management with position-based selection"

### Feature Files Confirm
- `player-roster-selection.feature` - Roster-based model ‚úì
- `roster-management.feature` - One-time draft with NFL players ‚úì

### Impact
- **Developers** may implement wrong API endpoints
- **Frontend** team will be confused about which endpoints to use
- **Inconsistent** with approved requirements

### Recommendation
**üîß REQUIRED CHANGE**: Remove ALL "team selection" endpoints (lines 577-664) and keep ONLY roster-based endpoints.

**Endpoints to Remove:**
- `POST /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/selections` (Make Team Selection)
- `GET /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/selections` (Get My Selections - team version)
- Complete Team Selection Flow example (lines 1065-1120)

**Endpoints to Keep:**
- `GET /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/roster` (Get My Roster)
- `POST /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/roster/slots/{slotId}/assign` (Assign Player)
- `DELETE /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/roster/slots/{slotId}` (Remove Player)
- `POST /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/roster/transactions` (Drop/Add)

## Issue #2: ARCHITECTURE.md - Wrong Domain Entities ‚ùå

### Problem
The ARCHITECTURE.md uses **TeamSelection** as a core domain entity throughout the document.

### Found References (29 occurrences)
```
Line 49:  - MakeTeamSelectionUseCase
Line 68:  - TeamSelection
Line 85:  - TeamSelectionValidator
Line 105: Entities: League, Player, User, TeamSelection, Score
Line 119: // domain/model/TeamSelection.java
          public class TeamSelection {
              private NFLTeam team;
              private Week week;
              private boolean eliminated;
          }
```

### Correct Domain Model (from requirements.md & features)
```
Roster (aggregate root)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RosterSelection (entity)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rosterSlot: RosterSlot (position)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nflPlayer: NFLPlayer (individual player)
```

### Requirements.md States (Section 2.6)
> "Roster contains multiple RosterSelections (one per roster slot)"
> "RosterSelection links RosterSlot to NFLPlayer"

### Impact
- **Architecture** document contradicts requirements
- **Domain model** examples show wrong structure
- **Developers** will implement incorrect aggregates

### Recommendation
**üîß REQUIRED CHANGE**: Replace all "TeamSelection" references with correct roster model:

**Replace:**
- `TeamSelection` entity ‚Üí `RosterSelection` entity
- `MakeTeamSelectionUseCase` ‚Üí `AssignRosterSlotUseCase`
- `TeamSelectionValidator` ‚Üí `RosterPositionValidator`
- `player.selectTeam(teamName, week)` ‚Üí `roster.assignPlayer(nflPlayer, slot)`

**Add Missing Entities:**
- `Roster` aggregate
- `RosterSlot` value object
- `NFLPlayer` entity
- `Position` enum (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF, FLEX, Superflex)

## Issue #3: domain-model-validation.md - Incomplete Coverage ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Problem
The document **only covers configuration lock** rules but is missing **roster lock** validation, which is equally critical.

### Current Coverage
‚úÖ League configuration immutability after first game starts
‚ùå Roster lock validation rules (MISSING)

### Requirements.md States (Section 2)
> "**ONE-TIME DRAFT MODEL** - rosters are built ONCE before the season"
> "**Roster Lock**: Rosters are PERMANENTLY LOCKED once the first game starts"
> "After roster lock, NO changes are allowed for the entire season"
> "No waiver wire, no trades, no weekly lineup changes"

### Feature Files Confirm
- `roster-management.feature` line 151: "Permanent roster lock when first game starts"
- `roster-lock.feature`: Entire feature file dedicated to roster lock rules

### Missing Content
The document should include:

#### Roster Domain Model
```java
public class Roster {
    private Boolean isLocked;
    private Instant lockTimestamp;
    private LockReason lockReason; // FIRST_GAME_STARTED

    public void validateRosterMutable() {
        if (isLocked) {
            throw new RosterLockedException(
                "Roster is permanently locked - no changes allowed"
            );
        }
    }

    public void assignPlayer(NFLPlayer player, RosterSlot slot) {
        validateRosterMutable(); // VALIDATION GUARD
        // ... assignment logic
    }
}
```

#### Validation Rules
1. Roster becomes immutable when first game of league starts
2. NO changes after lock: no add, no drop, no swap
3. BYE weeks and injuries: player scores 0, cannot be replaced
4. Validation method called before ANY roster modification
5. Domain event: `RosterLockedEvent`

### Impact
- **Incomplete** validation rules documented
- **Roster lock** is a core business rule but not covered
- **Missing** from architecture documentation

### Recommendation
**üîß REQUIRED ADDITION**: Add "Roster Lock Validation Rules" section to domain-model-validation.md

**Should Include:**
1. Roster aggregate attributes (`isLocked`, `lockTimestamp`)
2. Validation methods (`validateRosterMutable()`)
3. Lock lifecycle (DRAFT ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí LOCKED ‚Üí COMPLETED)
4. Immutable operations (all roster changes)
5. Domain events (`RosterLockedEvent`)
6. Error handling (`RosterLockedException`)
7. Unit tests for roster lock validation

---

## Issue #4: ARCHITECTURE.md - Missing Roster Aggregate Documentation ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Problem
The "Domain Model" section (lines 367-405) does NOT include the **Roster** aggregate, which is a primary aggregate in the system.

### Current Aggregates Documented
1. ‚úÖ League Aggregate
2. ‚úÖ Player Aggregate (but wrong - says "TeamSelection")
3. ‚úÖ User Aggregate

### Missing
4. ‚ùå **Roster Aggregate** (NOT documented)
5. ‚ùå **NFLPlayer Aggregate** (NOT documented)

### Correct Structure (from requirements.md)
```
### 3. Roster Aggregate
**Root Entity**: Roster

**Properties**:
- id, leaguePlayerId, status, lockTimestamp, rosterSelections[]

**Entities**:
- RosterSelection (links RosterSlot to NFLPlayer)

**Business Rules**:
- ONE-TIME DRAFT model - roster locked once first game starts
- After lock, NO changes allowed for entire season
- Must fill all positions before validation passes
- Cannot select same NFL player twice in roster
- Position eligibility validated (e.g., QB slot only accepts QB)
```

### Recommendation
**üîß REQUIRED ADDITION**: Add complete Roster aggregate documentation to ARCHITECTURE.md

---

## Issue #5: API.md - Inconsistent Response Examples ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Problem
Some response examples show data that doesn't match the roster-based model.

### Example: Get My Selections (Line 636-663)
```json
{
  "selections": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "teamName": "Kansas City Chiefs",
      "eliminated": false,
      "score": 87.5
    }
  ]
}
```

This shows **team-based** selections with elimination per team.

### Correct Response (Roster-Based Model)
```json
{
  "rosterId": "uuid",
  "isLocked": true,
  "slots": [
    {
      "position": "QB",
      "nflPlayer": {
        "id": 1001,
        "name": "Patrick Mahomes",
        "team": "Kansas City Chiefs",
        "fantasyPoints": 215.4
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Recommendation
**üîß REQUIRED CHANGE**: Update all response examples to match roster model

## Action Items

### For API.md
- [ ] Remove team selection endpoints (DELETE lines 577-664)
- [ ] Remove team selection flow example (DELETE lines 1065-1120)
- [ ] Update "Get My Selections" to "Get My Roster" with roster response
- [ ] Update score breakdown to show roster breakdown not team
- [ ] Add roster lock enforcement notes to all roster endpoints

### For ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Find/Replace: "TeamSelection" ‚Üí "RosterSelection"
- [ ] Find/Replace: "MakeTeamSelectionUseCase" ‚Üí "AssignRosterSlotUseCase"
- [ ] Add Roster Aggregate section (after Player Aggregate)
- [ ] Add NFLPlayer Aggregate section
- [ ] Update example code to use roster.assignPlayer() not player.selectTeam()
- [ ] Update domain model diagram to show Roster aggregate
- [ ] Update data flow to show roster building flow

### For domain-model-validation.md
- [ ] Add new section: "## Roster Aggregate - Permanent Lock"
- [ ] Document Roster attributes (isLocked, lockTimestamp, lockReason)
- [ ] Document validateRosterMutable() method
- [ ] Document RosterLockedException
- [ ] Document RosterLockedEvent domain event
- [ ] Add roster lock lifecycle phases
- [ ] Add unit tests for roster lock validation
- [ ] Add audit logging for roster modification attempts after lock

---

## Estimated Effort

- **API.md**: 2-3 hours (remove old endpoints, update examples)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: 3-4 hours (replace entities, add aggregates, update diagrams)
- **domain-model-validation.md**: 2 hours (add roster lock section)

**Total**: 7-9 hours

---

## Conclusion

The documentation has **significant inconsistencies** that must be resolved before implementation begins. The primary issue is mixing the old team-based model with the correct roster-based model, which will cause confusion and incorrect implementation.

**RECOMMENDATION**: **DO NOT PROCEED** with implementation until these documentation issues are resolved.

The feature files in `features/` directory are CORRECT and should be the source of truth. The docs should be updated to match the feature files and requirements.md.
