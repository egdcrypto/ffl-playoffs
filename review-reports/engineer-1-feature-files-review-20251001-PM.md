# Review: Engineer 1 (Feature Architect) - Feature Files
Date: 2025-10-01
Reviewer: Product Manager

## Summary
Engineer 1 has created 24 comprehensive feature files covering all major aspects of the FFL Playoffs system. However, there is a CRITICAL ISSUE: **one feature file implements an incorrect game model** that directly contradicts requirements.md.

## Requirements Compliance

### CRITICAL ISSUE ❌

**`features/player-selection.feature` - INCORRECT GAME MODEL**
- **Issue**: This file implements a **week-by-week selection model** where players select ONE NFL player per week
- **Location**: Lines 11-20, 21-31, 98-108
- **Problem**: This contradicts requirements.md Section 2 "Roster Building and Player Selection" (lines 112-148)
- **Requirements state**:
  - "CRITICAL: This is a ONE-TIME DRAFT model - rosters are built ONCE before the season" (requirements.md:136)
  - "Rosters are PERMANENTLY LOCKED once the first game starts" (requirements.md:140)
  - "After roster lock, NO changes are allowed for the entire season" (requirements.md:141)
  - "No waiver wire, no trades, no weekly lineup changes" (requirements.md:142)

**Impact**: This file describes a fundamentally different game than what is specified in requirements.md.

**Fix Required**: DELETE this file or completely rewrite it to align with the one-time draft model.
