### ❌ FAIL - Needs Fixing

1. **Player Invitation** ❌ INCORRECT
   - File: `player-invitation.feature`
   - **Issue**: Does NOT implement league-scoped invitations
   - **Location**: Throughout the entire file
   - **Expected**: Invitations should include `leagueId` and be league-specific
   - **Actual**: Invitations are to "the game" without league context
   - **Requirements Reference**: requirements.md:100-110 clearly states:
     > "Player Invitation to Specific Leagues"
     > "Admins can invite players ONLY to leagues they own"
     > "Invitation specifies which league the player is joining"
     > "Player belongs to specific league(s), not globally to the system"

   **Fix Required**:
   - Add `leagueId` to invitation scenarios
   - Update scenarios to show admin inviting player to SPECIFIC league
   - Add LeaguePlayer junction table creation on acceptance
   - Add scenarios for multi-league membership
   - Update Background to include league context

## Recommendations

[ ] APPROVED - ready to merge
[ ] APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES - can merge after small fixes
[X] CHANGES REQUIRED - must fix before approval
[ ] REJECTED - does not meet requirements

## Next Steps

**For Engineer 1 (Feature Architect)**:

1. **PRIORITY 1**: Fix `player-invitation.feature` immediately
   - Implement league-scoped invitations as per requirements.md:100-110
   - Add leagueId to invitation data model

2. **PRIORITY 2**: Review and consolidate any duplicate feature files
3. **PRIORITY 3**: Complete coverage verification
