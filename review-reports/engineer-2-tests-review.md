# Review: Engineer 2 (Project Structure) - Test Implementation
Date: 2025-10-01
Reviewer: Product Manager

## Summary
Engineer 2 created test files in ffl-playoffs-api/src/test/ but most tests are not implemented (TODO placeholders). Additionally, a duplicate feature file was created that overlaps with Engineer 1's work.

## Requirements Compliance

### Hexagonal Architecture ✅
- ✅ Domain tests (GameTest) have NO framework dependencies - PASS
- ✅ Infrastructure tests (GameControllerTest) properly use Spring Boot - PASS
- ✅ Test structure follows hexagonal layers (domain/application/infrastructure) - PASS

### Test Implementation ❌
- ❌ CreateGameUseCaseTest.java - NOT IMPLEMENTED (TODO only)
  - Location: ffl-playoffs-api/src/test/java/com/ffl/playoffs/application/CreateGameUseCaseTest.java:9
  - Issue: Test method is empty with TODO comment
  - Fix: Implement actual test logic for game creation use case

- ❌ GameControllerTest.java - NOT IMPLEMENTED (TODO only)
  - Location: ffl-playoffs-api/src/test/java/com/ffl/playoffs/infrastructure/GameControllerTest.java:10
  - Issue: Test method is empty with TODO comment
  - Fix: Implement actual test logic for game controller endpoint

### Separation of Concerns ❌
- ❌ Duplicate feature file created in test/resources
  - Location: ffl-playoffs-api/src/test/resources/features/game.feature
  - Issue: Engineer 2 created a BDD feature file, which is Engineer 1's responsibility. Engineer 1 already has comprehensive feature files in features/ folder including game-management.feature
  - Fix: Remove this duplicate feature file. Feature files should only be created/maintained by Engineer 1 (Feature Architect)

## Findings

### What's Correct ✅
- GameTest.java properly tests domain model construction
- Test package structure follows hexagonal architecture layers
- No framework dependencies in domain layer tests
- JUnit 5 is being used (modern testing framework)

### What Needs Fixing ❌
- **Empty test implementations**: CreateGameUseCaseTest.java:9 and GameControllerTest.java:10 have TODO placeholders instead of actual tests
- **Duplicate feature file**: ffl-playoffs-api/src/test/resources/features/game.feature duplicates Engineer 1's work and violates separation of concerns
- **Limited domain test coverage**: GameTest.java only tests basic construction, missing validation, state transitions, business rules

## Recommendation
- [ ] APPROVED - ready to merge
- [ ] APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES - can merge after small fixes
- [X] CHANGES REQUIRED - must fix before approval
- [ ] REJECTED - does not meet requirements

## Next Steps
1. Route message to Engineer 2: Implement the TODO tests in CreateGameUseCaseTest and GameControllerTest
2. Route message to Engineer 2: Remove the duplicate feature file from test/resources/features/
3. Route message to Engineer 2: Expand GameTest to cover validation and business rules
4. After fixes, re-review the test implementation
