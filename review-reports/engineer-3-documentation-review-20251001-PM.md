# Review: Engineer 3 (Documentation) - Documentation Files
Date: 2025-10-01
Reviewer: Product Manager

## Summary
Engineer 3 has created comprehensive, well-structured documentation covering all major aspects of the FFL Playoffs system. The documentation correctly describes the ONE-TIME DRAFT model, NO ownership model, hexagonal architecture, and Envoy sidecar security. One minor inconsistency found regarding legacy "TeamSelection" entity references.

### Minor Inconsistency ⚠️

**ARCHITECTURE.md References Legacy "TeamSelection" Entity**
- **Location**: `ARCHITECTURE.md:68, 105`
- **Issue**: References "TeamSelection" entity which appears to be from the old week-by-week model
- **Current Model**: Should reference "Roster", "RosterSlot", "NFLPlayer" instead
- **Impact**: Minor - causes confusion about which model is current
- **Note**: DATA_MODEL.md correctly documents the roster-based model

**Recommendation**: Update ARCHITECTURE.md to replace "TeamSelection" references with roster-based entities
