## What Needs Fixing ❌

### 1. ⚠️ **MINOR INCONSISTENCY**: NFL Week Range in API.md

**File**: API.md
**Line**: 397-404
**Issue**: Documentation states `startingWeek + numberOfWeeks - 1 must be ≤ 18`, but requirements.md specifies NFL weeks go to 22 (including playoffs).

**Current**:
```json
{
  "error": "INVALID_LEAGUE_CONFIGURATION",
  "message": "startingWeek + numberOfWeeks - 1 must be ≤ 18",
  "details": {
    "startingWeek": 17,
    "numberOfWeeks": 4,
    "maxWeek": 20,
    "allowed": 18
  }
}
```

**Should Be**:
```json
{
  "error": "INVALID_LEAGUE_CONFIGURATION",
  "message": "startingWeek + numberOfWeeks - 1 must be ≤ 22",
  "details": {
    "startingWeek": 20,
    "numberOfWeeks": 4,
    "maxWeek": 23,
    "allowed": 22
  }
}
```

**Required Changes**:
- API.md line 397: Change `allowed: 18` to `allowed: 22`
- API.md line 397: Update validation message from `≤ 18` to `≤ 22`
- domain-model-validation.md line 105: Update validation from `> 18` to `> 22`

**Requirements Evidence**: requirements.md line 224 states "Validation: startingWeek + numberOfWeeks - 1 ≤ 22 (cannot exceed NFL season including playoffs)"

---

### 2. ⚠️ **MINOR INCONSISTENCY**: ARCHITECTURE.md League Aggregate Week Validation

**File**: ARCHITECTURE.md
**Line**: 379
**Issue**: States `startingWeek + numberOfWeeks ≤ 18` but requirements specify ≤ 22.

**Current**:
```java
// Validate league configuration (startingWeek + numberOfWeeks ≤ 18)
```

**Should Be**:
```java
// Validate league configuration (startingWeek + numberOfWeeks - 1 ≤ 22)
```

**Note**: Also needs the `-1` added to match the requirements exactly.

---

### 3. ⚠️ **MINOR ENHANCEMENT**: Team Selection References in ARCHITECTURE.md

**File**: ARCHITECTURE.md
**Lines**: Multiple references to "TeamSelection" entity
**Issue**: ARCHITECTURE.md still contains references to the old "team selection" elimination model (lines 68, 105, 119-138, 169, 384-390, 443-466, etc.). While these are in the context of explaining hexagonal architecture patterns, they may cause confusion since the actual implementation uses roster-based model.

**Recommendation**:
- Add a prominent note at the top of ARCHITECTURE.md stating: "Note: Code examples use 'TeamSelection' for illustration of hexagonal architecture patterns. The actual implementation uses a roster-based model with NFL player selection. See DATA_MODEL.md for current data model."
- OR update all examples to use roster-based entities (Roster, RosterSlot, NFLPlayer)

**Evidence**: DATA_MODEL.md lines 3-7 clearly state the current model is roster-based.

## Consistency Across Documentation

### Cross-Reference Verification

| Concept | ARCHITECTURE.md | API.md | DATA_MODEL.md | DEPLOYMENT.md | Status |
|---------|-----------------|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Three-tier roles | ✅ Referenced | ✅ Lines 139-146 | ❌ Not explicitly mentioned | ✅ Implied | ⚠️ Minor - DATA_MODEL should mention |
| ONE-TIME DRAFT | ✅ Lines 626-715 (config lock) | ✅ Lines 898, 963, 980 | ✅ Lines 90-106 | N/A | ✅ Consistent |
| NO ownership | N/A | ✅ Implied by no restrictions | ✅ Lines 123-128 | N/A | ✅ Consistent |
| Roster lock trigger | ✅ Lines 647-648 | ✅ Lines 949-954 | ✅ Lines 131-132 | N/A | ✅ Consistent |
| League-scoped players | ✅ Lines 380, 407 | ✅ Lines 458-480 | ✅ Lines 141-156 | N/A | ✅ Consistent |
| Envoy port 443 | N/A | ✅ Lines 34-45 | N/A | ✅ Lines 36-37 | ✅ Consistent |
| Auth service port 9191 | N/A | ✅ Lines 60-64 | N/A | ✅ Lines 50-58 | ✅ Consistent |
| API port 8080 | N/A | ✅ Line 226 | N/A | ✅ Lines 496-503 | ✅ Consistent |
| MongoDB connection | N/A | N/A | N/A | ✅ Lines 394-395 | ✅ Consistent |
| NFL week range 1-22 | ❌ Line 379 says ≤18 | ❌ Line 397 says ≤18 | N/A | N/A | ❌ NEEDS FIX |

## Documentation Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major system aspects documented
2. ✅ **Clear Examples**: Code examples provided throughout
3. ✅ **Accurate Technical Details**: Port numbers, service names, flow diagrams correct
4. ✅ **Consistent Formatting**: Markdown formatted consistently across files
5. ✅ **Good Cross-References**: Files reference each other appropriately
6. ✅ **Practical Guidance**: DEVELOPMENT.md provides actionable setup instructions
7. ✅ **Security Emphasis**: DEPLOYMENT.md clearly explains zero-trust model
