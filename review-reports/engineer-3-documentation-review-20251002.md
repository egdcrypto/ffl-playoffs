## Key Documentation Highlights

### NO Ownership Model ✅
**DATA_MODEL.md** clearly states:
```
Player Availability:
- Multiple league players CAN select the same NFL player
- NO ownership restrictions
- NOT a traditional draft where players become unavailable
- All NFL players remain available throughout draft phase
```

**ARCHITECTURE.md** clearly states:
```
4. **No Ownership Model**: Multiple league players can select the same NFL player (unlimited availability)
```

### ONE-TIME DRAFT Model ✅
**ARCHITECTURE.md** clearly states:
```
3. **ONE-TIME DRAFT Model**: Rosters are built ONCE before the season and PERMANENTLY LOCKED when the first NFL game starts

**Critical Business Rule - Roster Lock**:
- **Pre-Lock Phase (Draft Phase)**: League players can modify their rosters (add/drop NFL players) until first game starts
- **Post-Lock Phase (Season Active)**: Once first NFL game starts, rosters are PERMANENTLY LOCKED for entire season
  - NO waiver wire pickups allowed
  - NO trades between league players
  - NO lineup changes week-to-week
  - NO player replacements (even for injuries)
  - League players must compete with their locked rosters for the full duration
```

### MongoDB Database ✅
**ARCHITECTURE.md** correctly specifies:
```
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Data MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB 6+
```

No incorrect references to PostgreSQL or JPA in documentation!

### League-Scoped Membership ✅
**DATA_MODEL.md** comprehensively documents:
```
#### LeaguePlayer (Junction Entity)
Junction entity linking Users to Leagues/Games, enabling multi-league membership.

**Purpose**: Represents a user's membership in a specific league with league-scoped data and status tracking.

**Multi-League Support**: A User can have multiple LeaguePlayer records, one for each league they're a member of.
```

## Consistency with Other Deliverables

✅ **Consistent with Feature Files (Engineer 1)**:
- Documentation matches feature file scenarios
- NO ownership model documented matches feature implementation
- ONE-TIME DRAFT model documented matches roster lock features
- League-scoped membership matches player invitation features

✅ **Consistent with Requirements**:
- All requirements.md specifications reflected in documentation
- MongoDB 6+ database requirement correctly documented
- Hexagonal architecture requirement documented
- Envoy sidecar security requirement documented

⚠️ **Inconsistent with Code (Engineer 2)**:
- **Documentation is CORRECT** - specifies MongoDB 6+
- **Code is INCORRECT** - configured for PostgreSQL with JPA
- This discrepancy was identified in Engineer 2 review
- Engineer 2 needs to fix code to match documentation and requirements

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Documentation Approved** - No changes needed to documentation
2. ✅ **Use as Reference** - Documentation can guide implementation and onboarding
3. ⚠️ **Code Must Match Documentation** - Engineer 2 must fix code to use MongoDB (not PostgreSQL)
4. ✅ **Maintain Consistency** - Keep documentation updated as implementation progresses

## Summary

**EXCELLENT WORK!** Engineer 3 has delivered comprehensive, accurate documentation that:
- ✅ Correctly documents NO ownership model
- ✅ Correctly documents individual NFL player selection
- ✅ Correctly documents league-scoped membership via LeaguePlayer
- ✅ Correctly documents ONE-TIME DRAFT with permanent roster lock
- ✅ Correctly documents MongoDB 6+ as database (unlike the code!)
- ✅ Correctly documents hexagonal architecture
- ✅ Correctly documents Envoy sidecar security
- ✅ Provides comprehensive API, deployment, and development guides

The documentation is ready to serve as the definitive reference for the project.
