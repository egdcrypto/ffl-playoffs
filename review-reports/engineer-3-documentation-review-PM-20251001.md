# Review: Engineer 3 - Documentation Engineer
Date: 2025-10-01
Reviewer: Product Manager

## Summary
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL MIXED MODEL ISSUE**: Documentation contains references to BOTH the correct roster-based fantasy football model AND the incorrect team elimination/weekly selection model. API.md is the most severely affected with contradictory endpoint documentation. Immediate cleanup required before any frontend or integration development proceeds.

## Requirements Compliance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Mixed Game Model Documentation

The documentation describes **TWO CONFLICTING GAME MODELS**:

**CORRECT MODEL** (should be documented):
- ONE-TIME DRAFT with individual NFL player roster building
- Individual NFL players selected by position (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DEF)
- Rosters built ONCE, locked permanently at first game
- PPR scoring based on individual player performance

**INCORRECT MODEL** (should NOT be documented):
- Weekly team selection/elimination pool
- NFL teams selected weekly
- Team elimination mechanics
- Weekly pick deadlines

## Findings by File

### ‚ùå API.md - CRITICAL CONFLICTS (MAJOR REWRITE REQUIRED)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MIXED MODEL** - Most severely affected file

**INCORRECT MODEL Documentation** (MUST DELETE):
- **Lines 502-507**: Admin endpoint shows `teamSelections` field
- **Lines 510-531**: "View All Player Selections (Admin View)" returns team selections with `team: "Kansas City Chiefs"`, `eliminated: false`
- **Lines 583-634**: "Make Team Selection" endpoint (`POST /api/v1/player/leagues/{leagueId}/selections`)
- **Lines 614-622**: Error "TEAM_ALREADY_SELECTED" - team elimination pool logic
- **Lines 625-634**: Error "SELECTION_DEADLINE_PASSED" - weekly deadline logic
- **Lines 636-670**: "Get My Selections" returns team selections by week with eliminated teams
- **Lines 663-669**: `eliminatedTeams: []`, `availableTeams: []` - team pool logic
- **Lines 672-702**: Leaderboard shows `eliminatedTeams` count
- **Lines 704-736**: Score breakdown for NFL TEAM performance (not individual players)
- **Lines 1071-1121**: Complete team selection flow example
- **Lines 1262-1281**: TeamEliminatedEvent webhook documentation

**CORRECT MODEL Documentation** (KEEP):
- **Lines 740-791**: "Search NFL Players" endpoint ‚úÖ
- **Lines 793-833**: "Get NFL Player Details" ‚úÖ
- **Lines 835-896**: "Get My Roster" - Individual NFL player roster slots ‚úÖ
- **Lines 898-961**: "Assign Player to Roster Slot" ‚úÖ
- **Line 904**: Warning "‚ö†Ô∏è ONE-TIME DRAFT: This endpoint ONLY works before the first game starts" ‚úÖ
- **Lines 963-978**: "Remove Player from Roster Slot" with roster lock ‚úÖ
- **Lines 980-1012**: "Drop and Add Player" transaction ‚úÖ
- **Lines 1014-1040**: Roster configuration with position slots ‚úÖ

**Issues**:
- File documents BOTH incompatible models simultaneously
- Leaderboard uses team elimination logic instead of roster PPR scoring
- Score breakdown shows team-level stats instead of individual player PPR

**Action Required**:
1. DELETE all team selection endpoints (lines 510-670, 1071-1121)
2. DELETE TeamEliminatedEvent documentation (lines 1268-1281)
3. KEEP roster management endpoints (lines 740-1040)
4. REWRITE leaderboard to show cumulative roster PPR scores
5. ADD roster lock enforcement documentation
6. ADD PPR scoring calculation endpoint documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURE.md - MODERATE CONFLICTS (REWRITE SECTIONS)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MIXED MODEL**

**INCORRECT MODEL Documentation** (MUST DELETE):
- **Line 68**: Domain model lists "TeamSelection" entity
- **Lines 383-390**: Player aggregate contains "TeamSelections" child entities
- **Lines 433-466**: "Team Selection Flow" - selecting NFL teams by week
- **Lines 446-457**: Validation for "Team not already selected" and "Week not locked"
- **Lines 459-460**: TeamSelection entity and TeamSelectedEvent
- **Lines 495-514**: "Team Elimination Flow" with WIN/LOSS/TIE logic
- **Lines 501-507**: Team elimination mechanics and TeamEliminatedEvent

**CORRECT MODEL Documentation** (KEEP):
- **Line 3**: Header note "under active development" ‚úÖ
- **Lines 626-699**: Configuration immutability after game starts ‚úÖ
- Hexagonal architecture principles ‚úÖ

**Missing Documentation**:
- RosterSlot entity
- One-time draft process flow
- Roster lock mechanism and enforcement
- PPR scoring calculation flow
- Individual player stat aggregation

**Action Required**:
1. DELETE Team Selection Flow (lines 433-466)
2. DELETE Team Elimination Flow (lines 495-514)
3. UPDATE domain model to remove TeamSelection, add RosterSlot
4. ADD Roster Building Flow (pre-lock phase)
5. ADD Roster Lock Flow (triggered by first game start)
6. ADD Weekly Scoring Flow (PPR calculation for all roster players)

5. UPDATE games collection to reference rosters:
   ```javascript
   players: [{
     id: UUID,
     gameId: UUID,
     name: String,
     email: String,
     status: String,  // INVITED, ACTIVE (no ELIMINATED)
     joinedAt: ISODate,
     rosterId: UUID   // Reference to rosters collection
   }]
   ```

## Documentation Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **DATA_MODEL.md Entity Definitions**: Excellent documentation of roster-based entities
2. **DATA_MODEL.md Business Rules**: Clear ONE-TIME DRAFT rules (lines 175-226)
3. **API.md Roster Endpoints**: Well-documented individual player roster management (lines 740-1040)
4. **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Comprehensive infrastructure documentation
5. **PAT_MANAGEMENT.md**: Clear authentication documentation
6. **domain-model-validation.md**: Precise configuration lock rules

### ‚ùå Critical Issues

1. **API.md Contradictory Endpoints**: Documents BOTH team selection AND roster endpoints
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md Wrong Flows**: Team selection and elimination flows documented
3. **Inconsistent Domain Model**: TeamSelection vs. RosterSlot confusion
4. **Schema Mismatch**: Games collection has teamSelections instead of roster references

## Impact Analysis

### Risk Level: **üö® CRITICAL**

**Impact on Development**:
- Frontend developers may implement wrong UI (team selection vs roster building)
- Backend developers may build wrong endpoints (already happened - see Engineer 2 review)
- Database schema misaligned with requirements
- Integration developers confused about actual API

**Impact on Project**:
- Blocks frontend development
- Blocks integration testing
- Creates technical debt
- Causes rework if code implemented based on wrong docs

## Recommendation

‚ö†Ô∏è **CHANGES REQUIRED - HIGH PRIORITY**

### Priority Actions

**PRIORITY 1 - API.md Cleanup (URGENT)**:
1. Delete ALL team selection endpoint documentation
2. Delete team elimination event documentation
3. Rewrite leaderboard endpoint for PPR roster scoring
4. Add PPR scoring calculation endpoint docs
5. Add clear ONE-TIME DRAFT warnings

**PRIORITY 2 - ARCHITECTURE.md Update**:
1. Remove Team Selection Flow section
2. Remove Team Elimination Flow section
3. Add Roster Building Flow
4. Add Roster Lock Flow
5. Add Weekly Scoring Flow (PPR calculation)
6. Update domain model diagrams

**PRIORITY 3 - DATA_MODEL.md Schema Fix**:
1. Remove teamSelections from games collection
2. Remove ELIMINATED from player status
3. Add rosterId reference to players
4. Document rosters collection relationships

**PRIORITY 4 - DEVELOPMENT.md Minor Updates**:
1. Update entity names (TeamSelection ‚Üí RosterSlot)
2. Update event names (TeamEliminatedEvent ‚Üí RosterLockedEvent)

## Requirements Coverage

### ‚úÖ Well-Documented Requirements

- Individual NFL player entities (DATA_MODEL.md lines 11-33)

- PlayerStats and DefensiveStats API endpoints
- NFLGame schedule integration
- Roster lock enforcement flow
- Weekly scoring calculation process

## Evidence Summary

| File | Status | Lines Correct | Lines Incorrect | Action |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| API.md | ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED | 740-1040 (roster) | 510-670, 1071-1281 (teams) | **MAJOR REWRITE** |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED | Architecture principles | 383-514 (flows) | **REWRITE SECTIONS** |
| DATA_MODEL.md | ‚úÖ MOSTLY CORRECT | 5-226 (entities/rules) | 345-356 (schema) | **FIX SCHEMA** |
| DEPLOYMENT.md | ‚úÖ CORRECT | All | None | **KEEP AS-IS** |
| domain-model-validation.md | ‚úÖ CORRECT | All | None | **KEEP AS-IS** |
| PAT_MANAGEMENT.md | ‚úÖ CORRECT | All | None | **KEEP AS-IS** |
| DEVELOPMENT.md | ‚úÖ MOSTLY CORRECT | All except 441-452 | 441-452 (entity names) | **MINOR UPDATES** |

## Next Steps

1. **Engineer 3**: Review this report immediately
2. **Engineer 3**: STOP all new documentation until cleanup complete
3. **Engineer 3**: Prioritize API.md cleanup (most critical)
4. **Engineer 3**: Coordinate with Engineer 1 (feature files) and Engineer 2 (code) on unified model
5. **Product Manager**: Schedule team alignment meeting on ONE-TIME DRAFT model
6. **All Engineers**: No implementation based on current API.md until corrections made

## Approval Status

**STATUS**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CHANGES REQUIRED - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Blocking Issues**:
1. API.md documents contradictory game models (team selection vs roster)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md documents incorrect flows (team selection, elimination)
3. DATA_MODEL.md schema section contradicts entity definitions
4. Frontend development blocked until API.md is corrected

**Positive Notes**:
- DATA_MODEL.md entity definitions and business rules are excellent
- DEPLOYMENT.md, PAT_MANAGEMENT.md, domain-model-validation.md are correct
- Core roster-based model IS documented, just mixed with incorrect model

**Can partially proceed** with deployment and authentication implementation, but **CANNOT proceed** with API integration or frontend development until documentation conflicts resolved.
