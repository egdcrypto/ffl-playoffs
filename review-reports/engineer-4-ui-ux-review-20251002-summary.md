## Recommendation

[ ] APPROVED WITH VERIFICATION - Comprehensive UI mockups delivered

**Verification Needed**:
1. Confirm "Build Roster" terminology is used consistently (appears to be done based on git commits)
2. Verify NO ownership model is reflected in player selection UI
3. Verify breadcrumb navigation is consistent across all mockups

## Next Steps

1. Full detailed review of mockups HTML files (time permitting)
2. Verify mockups reflect NO ownership model in player selection screens
3. Ensure roster lock UI clearly indicates permanent lock

## Files Reviewed
