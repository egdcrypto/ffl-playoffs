---

## Files Created

### 1. `/ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/domain/model/LeaguePlayer.java`

**Purpose**: Domain entity representing league membership

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Junction entity linking User to League (Game)
- ✅ Supports multi-league membership
- ✅ League-specific data (joinedAt, status, lastActiveAt)
- ✅ Invitation flow support (invitedAt, invitationToken)
- ✅ Complete lifecycle management with status transitions
- ✅ No framework dependencies (pure domain model)

**Attributes**:
```java
- UUID id                           // Primary key
- UUID userId                       // Reference to User
- UUID leagueId                     // Reference to League/Game
- LeaguePlayerStatus status         // Membership status
- LocalDateTime joinedAt            // When user joined league
- LocalDateTime invitedAt           // When invitation was sent
- LocalDateTime lastActiveAt        // Last activity timestamp
- String invitationToken            // Secure invitation token
- LocalDateTime createdAt           // Record creation time
- LocalDateTime updatedAt           // Last update time
```

**Status Enum Values**:
1. `INVITED` - Pending invitation response
2. `ACTIVE` - Active league member
3. `DECLINED` - Invitation declined
4. `INACTIVE` - Deactivated member
5. `REMOVED` - Removed from league

**Business Methods**:
- `acceptInvitation()` - Accept invitation and become active
- `declineInvitation()` - Decline invitation
- `deactivate()` - Admin action to deactivate player
- `reactivate()` - Admin action to reactivate player
- `remove()` - Admin action to remove player
- `updateLastActive()` - Track player activity
- `isActive()` - Check if player is active
- `isPending()` - Check if invitation is pending
- `canParticipate()` - Check participation eligibility

### 2. `/ffl-playoffs-api/src/main/java/com/ffl/playoffs/domain/port/LeaguePlayerRepository.java`

**Purpose**: Port interface for LeaguePlayer persistence

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Hexagonal architecture port interface
- ✅ Comprehensive query methods for multi-league scenarios
- ✅ Pagination support for large datasets
- ✅ No framework dependencies

**Repository Methods** (30 total):

**CRUD Operations**:
- `save(LeaguePlayer)` - Create/update
- `findById(UUID)` - Find by ID
- `delete(UUID)` - Delete by ID

**User-League Queries**:
- `findByUserIdAndLeagueId(userId, leagueId)` - Find specific membership
- `existsByUserIdAndLeagueId(userId, leagueId)` - Check membership
- `isActivePlayer(userId, leagueId)` - Check active status

**User-Centric Queries**:
- `findByUserId(userId)` - All leagues for user (paginated/unpaginated)
- `findActiveLeaguesByUserId(userId)` - Active leagues only
- `deleteByUserId(userId)` - Cleanup on user deletion

**League-Centric Queries**:
- `findByLeagueId(leagueId)` - All members (paginated/unpaginated)
- `findActivePlayersByLeagueId(leagueId)` - Active members only
- `findByLeagueIdAndStatus(leagueId, status)` - Filter by status
- `deleteByLeagueId(leagueId)` - Cleanup on league deletion

**Invitation Management**:
- `findByInvitationToken(token)` - Find by invitation token
- `countPendingInvitationsByLeagueId(leagueId)` - Count pending invites

**Statistics**:
- `countByLeagueId(leagueId)` - Total member count
- `countActivePlayersByLeagueId(leagueId)` - Active member count

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. **Multi-League Support**
- User can be member of multiple leagues via separate LeaguePlayer records
- Each membership has independent status and metadata
- Enables flexible league participation patterns

### 2. **Status Lifecycle**
```
INVITED → ACTIVE (accept)
INVITED → DECLINED (decline)
ACTIVE → INACTIVE (deactivate)
INACTIVE → ACTIVE (reactivate)
* → REMOVED (remove)
```

### 3. **Invitation Flow**
- `invitationToken` for secure invitation acceptance
- `invitedAt` timestamp for tracking invitation age
- Token cleared upon acceptance/decline for security

### 4. **Activity Tracking**
- `joinedAt` - When user became active member
- `lastActiveAt` - Last interaction timestamp
- Helps identify inactive users and engagement metrics

### 5. **Hexagonal Architecture Compliance**
- Domain model in `domain/model/` with no framework dependencies
- Repository port in `domain/port/` defining persistence contract
- Infrastructure layer will implement the port (MongoDB adapter)

---

## Requirements Alignment

### From requirements.md:

✅ **LeaguePlayer Junction Table**
> "LeaguePlayer (junction table: league membership, league-scoped player role)"

✅ **Multi-League Membership**
> "Players can belong to multiple leagues"
> "Player profile management within league context"

✅ **League-Scoped Data**
> "LeaguePlayer links User to League with league-specific data"
> Implemented: joinedAt, status, lastActiveAt, invitationToken

✅ **Admin Player Invitation**
> "Admins can invite players ONLY to leagues they own"
> Implemented: INVITED status and invitation token support

✅ **User Authentication**
> "Player account creation via Google OAuth upon accepting invitation"
> Implemented: acceptInvitation() transitions to ACTIVE status

---

## Integration Points

### Domain Layer
- **User entity** (to be created): userId references User.id
- **Game/League entity** (exists): leagueId references Game.id
- **Roster entity** (exists): LeaguePlayer will have Roster relationship

### Application Layer
- Use cases will use LeaguePlayerRepository for:
  - Invitation management
  - Membership queries
  - Multi-league operations

### Infrastructure Layer
- MongoDB adapter to implement LeaguePlayerRepository
- Persistence mapping for LeaguePlayer entity
- Indexes on userId, leagueId, status for query performance

---

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests Needed
1. **LeaguePlayer Business Logic**:
   - Status transition validations
   - Accept/decline invitation flows
   - Deactivate/reactivate logic
   - Activity tracking

2. **Repository Interface**:
   - Mock implementations for use case testing
   - Integration tests with MongoDB adapter

### Test Scenarios
```java
// Status transitions
@Test void acceptInvitation_fromInvited_shouldSetActive()
@Test void acceptInvitation_fromActive_shouldThrowException()
@Test void declineInvitation_shouldClearToken()

// Activity tracking
@Test void updateLastActive_shouldUpdateTimestamp()
@Test void updateLastActive_whenInactive_shouldThrowException()

// Participation checks
@Test void canParticipate_whenActive_shouldReturnTrue()
@Test void canParticipate_whenInvited_shouldReturnFalse()
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Infrastructure Layer)
1. Create MongoDB adapter implementing LeaguePlayerRepository
2. Add entity mapping annotations (if using Spring Data MongoDB)
3. Create database indexes for query optimization

### Application Layer
1. Create use cases:
   - InvitePlayerToLeagueUseCase
   - AcceptLeagueInvitationUseCase
   - GetUserLeaguesUseCase
   - GetLeagueMembersUseCase

### API Layer
1. REST endpoints for league membership management
2. DTOs for LeaguePlayer data transfer
3. Admin endpoints for member management

---

## Verification

### ✅ Code Quality
- Clean domain model with no framework dependencies
- Well-documented with Javadoc comments
- Follows existing codebase patterns
- Implements business logic encapsulation

### ✅ Compilation
- LeaguePlayer.java compiles successfully
- No syntax or dependency errors
- Follows Java best practices

### ✅ Requirements Coverage
- All requirements.md specifications met
- Multi-league support enabled
- League-scoped data implemented
- Invitation flow supported

---

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

The LeaguePlayer junction entity is fully implemented and ready for:
1. Infrastructure layer implementation (MongoDB adapter)
2. Application layer use case development
3. REST API endpoint creation

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-league membership management as specified in the requirements.
