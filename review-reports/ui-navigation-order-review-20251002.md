## Review Analysis

### ✅ What's Correct

1. **Logical Flow Improvement**
   - New order creates natural progression: Build → View → Compare
   - Makes more sense for user journey
   - Players build roster first, then view it, then check standings

2. **Consistency Across Variants**
   - ✅ player-dashboard.html: Navigation order updated
   - ✅ player-dashboard-prelock.html: Navigation order updated
   - ✅ player-dashboard-locked.html: Navigation order updated (shows "Browse Players" in locked state, which is correct)

3. **Implementation Quality**
   - No broken links
   - Consistent naming conventions maintained
   - Proper href references preserved

4. **UX Rationale**
   - **Build Roster** comes before **My Roster**: Users must build before viewing
   - Aligns with task-based mental model
   - Reduces cognitive load by matching workflow order

### ❌ Issues Found

**NONE** - All changes are correct and improve UX.

## Routing Note

**Task Routing Issue:**
- This task was routed to **engineer3 (Documentation Engineer)**

- Changes are correct and approved
- Will commit with proper attribution
- Notifying PM of routing issue for future reference

## Technical Verification

### Navigation Structure
```html
<!-- Updated navigation order -->
<li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link active" href="player-dashboard.html">Dashboard</a>
</li>
<li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" href="player-selection.html">Build Roster</a>  <!-- Moved up -->
</li>
<li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" href="my-roster.html">My Roster</a>  <!-- Moved down -->
</li>
<li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" href="league-standings.html">Standings</a>
</li>
```

### Variant Consistency Check

| File | Navigation Order | Status |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| player-dashboard.html | Dashboard → Build Roster → My Roster → Standings | ✅ Correct |
| player-dashboard-prelock.html | Dashboard → Build Roster → My Roster → Standings | ✅ Correct |
| player-dashboard-locked.html | Dashboard → Browse Players → My Roster → Standings | ✅ Correct (locked state) |

**Note:** Locked state shows "Browse Players" instead of "Build Roster" which is appropriate since roster is locked.
