## Design Consistency Analysis

### Color Coding Across States:
1. **Normal/Active State** - Blue navbar (bg-primary)
2. **Pre-lock Warning** - Green navbar (bg-success) with yellow warning
3. **Locked State** - Gray navbar (bg-secondary) with dark theme

**Assessment:** ✅ Consistent and intuitive color progression

### Position Badge Consistency:
All mockups use the same position color scheme:
- QB: Red (#dc3545)
- RB: Green (#198754)
- WR: Blue (#0d6efd)
- TE: Yellow (#ffc107)
- K: Gray (#6c757d)
- DEF: Purple (#6f42c1)

**Assessment:** ✅ Consistent across all player-selection mockups

### Bootstrap Integration:
- All mockups use Bootstrap 5.3.0
- Consistent use of Bootstrap Icons 1.10.0
- Proper responsive classes
- Standard Bootstrap color utilities

**Assessment:** ✅ Consistent framework usage

## ONE-TIME DRAFT Model Implementation

### Documentation Review:
All affected files properly document the ONE-TIME DRAFT model:
1. README.md explicitly warns about permanent lock
2. Index.html shows warning alert
3. Locked state clearly communicates "no changes for entire season"
4. Pre-lock state emphasizes urgency of deadline

**Assessment:** ✅ Model is clearly communicated across all touchpoints

### State Differentiation:
| State | Navbar | Badge | Banner | Functionality |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Normal | Blue | - | - | Full draft |
| Pre-lock | Green | PRE-LOCK | Yellow warning + timer | Full draft |
| Locked | Gray | ROSTERS LOCKED | Gray locked message | Browse only |

**Assessment:** ✅ Clear visual and functional distinction between states
