## 1. Login Screen

### Purpose
Google OAuth authentication flow for user login.

### API Endpoints

#### On Page Load
None - This is client-side Google OAuth flow

#### On Google Sign-In Success
**All subsequent requests** include:
```http
Header: Authorization: Bearer <google-jwt-token>
```

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" button
2. Google OAuth popup opens
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Frontend receives Google JWT token
5. Frontend stores JWT in localStorage/cookie
6. Frontend redirects to Player Dashboard
7. All subsequent API calls include JWT in Authorization header

### Authentication Headers (Automatically Added)
After JWT validation, Envoy adds these headers:
```
X-User-Id: 12345
X-User-Email: user@example.com
X-User-Role: PLAYER | ADMIN | SUPER_ADMIN
X-Google-Id: google-oauth2|123456789
```

### Error States

    "playerPosition": "WR",
    "slotPosition": "TE",

    "rosterDeadline": "2025-09-10T13:00:00Z",
    "lockedAt": "2025-09-10T13:00:00Z"
  }
}
```
**UI**: Gray out entire roster, show banner: "Roster locked. Season has started."

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout, tabs for Roster/Search
- **Tablet**: Side-by-side, narrower search panel
- **Desktop**: Full two-panel layout

---

## Common Patterns

### Loading States
All API calls should show loading indicators:
- **Button loading**: Spinner icon + disabled state
- **Page loading**: Skeleton screens matching final layout
- **Table loading**: Skeleton rows
- **Card loading**: Skeleton cards

### Error Handling
Standard error response format:
```json
{
  "error": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human-readable error message",
  "details": { /* context */ },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z",
  "path": "/api/v1/..."
}
```

Error UI patterns:
- **Inline errors**: Show below form fields
- **Toast notifications**: For success/error after actions
- **Modal dialogs**: For critical errors requiring acknowledgment
- **Error pages**: For 404, 403, 500 errors

### Authentication
All authenticated endpoints require:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <google-jwt-token>
```

On 401 Unauthorized response:
1. Clear stored JWT
2. Redirect to Login Screen
3. Show toast: "Session expired. Please sign in again."

On 403 Forbidden response:
1. Show error page: "You don't have permission to access this resource."
2. Provide "Go to Dashboard" button

### Polling Strategy
For real-time updates during live games:
- Poll every 30 seconds for leaderboard
- Poll every 60 seconds for score breakdowns
- Stop polling when games are final
- Use exponential backoff on errors

---

## API Base URL

All endpoints use base URL:
```
https://<pod-ip>/api/v1
```

For local development:
```
http://localhost:443/api/v1
```

---

## Next Steps
1. Implement authentication flow with Google OAuth
2. Create API client service layer with error handling
3. Build state management for API responses
4. Implement polling/refresh strategies
5. Add request caching to minimize API calls
