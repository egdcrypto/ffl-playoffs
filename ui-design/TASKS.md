## Design Principles
1. **Mobile-First**: Design for smallest screen first, then scale up
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works everywhere
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Important actions are obvious
4. **Feedback**: Loading, success, and error states are clear
5. **Consistency**: Reuse components and patterns
6. **Performance**: Minimize API calls, optimize images
7. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers, high contrast

---

## Technical Constraints
- Headless API backend (REST/GraphQL endpoints)
- Google OAuth for authentication
- JWT tokens for authorization
- Real-time updates needed for leaderboards
- Deadline countdowns need accurate time sync
- Mobile-responsive (not native apps)

---

## Key User Personas
1. **Player**: Casual user, checks in weekly to make picks
2. **Admin**: League creator, configures rules, invites players
3. **Super Admin**: Platform manager, creates admins, monitors system

---

## Notes
- Focus on Player Dashboard, Team Selection, and Leaderboard first (80% of usage)
- Admin screens can be more complex (power users)
- Super Admin can be desktop-only if needed
- Consider offline mode for viewing picks/standings
- Consider push notifications for deadlines
