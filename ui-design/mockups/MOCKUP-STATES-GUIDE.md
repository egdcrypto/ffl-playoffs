- Primary Color: `#198754` (Bootstrap Success Green)
- Badge Background: `bg-success`
- Icon: `bi-unlock-fill`
- Border: `4px solid #198754`

**Post-Lock State**:
- Primary Color: `#dc3545` (Bootstrap Danger Red)
- Badge Background: `bg-danger`
- Icon: `bi-lock-fill`
- Border: `4px solid #dc3545`

### Typography

**Lock Notices**:
```html

        <i class="bi bi-lock-fill"></i> Roster Permanently Locked
    </h5>
    <p class="mb-0">
        Your roster was locked on <strong>January 12, 2025 at 1:00 PM ET</strong>
        when the first game started. No changes can be made for the remainder of the season.
    </p>
</div>
```

**Countdown Timer** (Pre-Lock):
```html
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <i class="bi bi-clock-fill"></i>
    <strong>Time until roster lock: 2 hours 15 minutes</strong> - Complete your roster now!
</div>
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Pre-Lock State Testing
1. Verify all "Add to Roster" buttons are clickable
2. Verify countdown timer displays correctly
3. Verify draft warnings are prominent
4. Verify empty position slots are highlighted
5. Verify "Drop Player" modals work correctly

### Post-Lock State Testing
1. Verify NO edit buttons exist
2. Verify all "Add to Roster" buttons removed
3. Verify lock timestamp displays correctly
4. Verify "Roster Locked" badges appear
5. Verify tooltips show lock messages
6. Verify all links go to read-only views

---

## Bootstrap Components Used

- **Badges**: `badge bg-success`, `badge bg-danger`, `badge bg-secondary`
- **Alerts**: `alert alert-warning`, `alert alert-danger`, `alert alert-success`
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons (`bi-lock-fill`, `bi-unlock-fill`, `bi-clock-fill`)

## Collaboration Notes

**For Engineer 4**:

Current mockup files already created (by previous work):
- ‚úÖ `player-selection.html` - Can be used as base for `-prelock` version
- ‚úÖ `my-roster.html` - Already shows locked state, use as base for `-locked` version
- ‚úÖ `league-standings.html` - Already has lock warnings, use as base

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Copy existing mockups as starting point
2. Add/remove UI elements based on state (buttons, warnings, timers)
3. Update badges and visual indicators
4. Test both states side-by-side for consistency

**Questions/Clarifications**: Reach out if any state behavior is unclear.
