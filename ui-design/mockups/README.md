# HTML Mockups - FFL Playoffs

This directory contains interactive HTML mockups for all key screens of the FFL Playoffs application using a **roster-based fantasy football** model with **ONE-TIME DRAFT** mechanics.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: ONE-TIME DRAFT MODEL

These mockups demonstrate a **roster-based fantasy football system** where:
- League players build rosters by drafting **individual NFL players** (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF, FLEX, SUPERFLEX)
- Rosters are built **ONCE** before the season starts
- Rosters are **PERMANENTLY LOCKED** when the first game begins
- **NO waiver wire, NO trades, NO weekly lineup changes** for the entire season

## Available Mockups

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0** - CSS framework (CDN)
- **Bootstrap Icons 1.10.0** - Icon library (CDN)

## Key UI Patterns

### Roster Lock Warnings
- Prominent countdown timers showing time until permanent roster lock
- Different alert styles for incomplete vs. locked rosters
- Visual indicators (badges, progress bars) for roster completion

### Draft System
- Position filters (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF, FLEX, SUPERFLEX)
- NFL team filter and player name search
- Unavailable players marked when drafted by other league members
- Roster sidebar showing current selections

### Roster Display
- Position groupings (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF, FLEX, SUPERFLEX)
- Individual player cards with weekly scoring breakdown
- Total points aggregation across entire roster
- Locked roster status indicators

### League Standings
- Ranking table with expandable roster details
- Current user row highlighted
- Week-by-week scoring columns
- Top player badges for quick overview

## Next Steps

After stakeholder approval:
1. Convert mockups to React components with TypeScript
2. Implement with modern UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS)
3. Integrate with Spring Boot API (REST endpoints)
4. Add real-time score updates via WebSocket
5. Implement Google OAuth authentication flow
6. Add roster lock enforcement on backend
7. Implement draft system with player availability tracking

## Notes

- These are static mockups for design review and stakeholder feedback
- API calls are simulated (no backend integration yet)
- Real implementation will use React + modern UI framework
- See `../RESEARCH.md` for framework recommendations
- See `../API-INTEGRATION.md` for screen-to-endpoint mappings
- Bootstrap 5 used for rapid prototyping; may switch to Tailwind CSS for production
